Litecoin
is
a
peer-to-peer
cryptocurrency
and
open
source
software
project
released
under
the
MIT/X11
license
.
Creation
and
transfer
of
coins
is
based
on
an
open
source
cryptographic
protocol
and
is
not
managed
by
any
central
authority
.
The
coin
was
inspired
by
,
and
in
technical
details
is
nearly
identical
to
,
Bitcoin
(
BTC
)
.
Litecoin
was
released
via
an
open-source
client
on
GitHub
on
October
7
,
2011
by
Charlie
Lee
,
a
former
Google
employee
.
The
Litecoin
network
went
live
on
October
13
,
2011
.
It
was
a
fork
of
the
Bitcoin
Core
client
,
differing
primarily
by
having
a
decreased
block
generation
time
(
2.5
minutes
)
,
increased
maximum
number
of
coins
,
different
hashing
algorithm
(
scrypt
,
instead
of
SHA-256
)
,
and
a
slightly
modified
GUI
.
During
the
month
of
November
2013
,
the
aggregate
value
of
Litecoin
experienced
massive
growth
which
included
a
100
%
leap
within
24
hours
.
Litecoin
reached
a
$
1
billion
market
capitalization
in
November
2013
.
In
May
2017
,
Litecoin
became
the
first
of
the
top
5
(
by
market
cap
)
cryptocurrencies
to
adopt
Segregated
Witness
.
[

Later
in
May
of
the
same
year
,
the
first
Lightning
Network
transaction
was
completed
through
Litecoin
,
transferring
0.00000001
LTC
from
ZÃ¼rich
to
San
Francisco
in
under
one
second
.
In
February
2018
,
the
EU
online
retailer
Alza.cz
began
accepting
Litecoin
as
a
payment
method
.
Litecoin
is
different
in
some
ways
from
Bitcoin
.
The
Litecoin
Network
aims
to
process
a
block
every
2.5
minutes
,
rather
than
Bitcoin
's
10
minutes
.
The
developers
claim
that
this
allows
Litecoin
to
have
faster
transaction
confirmation
.
Litecoin
uses
scrypt
in
its
proof-of-work
algorithm
,
a
sequential
memory-hard
function
requiring
asymptotically
more
memory
than
an
algorithm
which
is
not
memory-hard
.
Due
to
Litecoin
's
use
of
the
scrypt
algorithm
,
FPGA
and
ASIC
devices
made
for
mining
Litecoin
are
more
complicated
to
create
and
more
expensive
to
produce
than
they
are
for
Bitcoin
,
which
uses
SHA-256
.
