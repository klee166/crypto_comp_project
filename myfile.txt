.I Bitcoin Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.Bitcoin.org is community supported: 3FkenCiXpSLqD8L79intRNXUgjRoH9sjXaBitcoin Price From CoinMarketCap

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency created by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009. It does not rely on a central server to process transactions or store funds. There are a maximum of 2,099,999,997,690,000 Bitcoin elements (called Satoshis, the unit has been named in collective homage to the original creator), which are currently most commonly measured in units of 100,000,000 known as BTC. There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin (BTC) to ever be created. 	
As of January 2018, it is the most widely used alternative currency, now with the total market cap around 250 billion US dollars.[1]
Bitcoin has no central issuer; instead, the peer-to-peer network regulates Bitcoins, transactions and issuance according to consensus in network software. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. 	
Bitcoins are issued to various nodes that verify transactions through computing power;it is established that there will be a limited and scheduled release of no more than 21 million BTC worth of coins, which will be fully issued by the year 2140.  
Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. As of February 2015, CoinJolt provided over 100,000 merchants and vendors accepted Bitcoin as payment. Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimates that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using Bitcoin. 	
Internationally, Bitcoins can be exchanged and managed through various websites and software along with physical banknotes and coins.
Alice wants to buy alpaca socks which Bob has for sale. In return, she must provide something of equal value to Bob. The most efficient way to do this is by using a medium of exchange that Bob accepts which would be classified as currency. Currency makes trade easier by eliminating the need for coincidence of wants required in other systems of trade such as barter. Currency adoption and acceptance can be global, national, or in some cases local or community-based.
Alice doesn't necessarily needs to be in direct contact with bob in order for the funds to be transferred. She may instead transfer this value by first entrusting her currency to a bank who promises to store and protect Alice's currency notes. The bank gives Alice a written promise (called a "bank statement") that entitles her to withdraw the same number of currency bills that she deposited. Since the money is still Alice's, she is entitled to do with it whatever she pleases, and the bank (like most banks), for a small fee, will do Alice the service of passing on the currency bills to Bob on her behalf. This is done by Alice's bank by giving the dollar bills to Bob's bank and informing them that the money is for Bob, who will then see the amount the next time he checks his balance or receives his bank statement.
Since banks have many customers, and bank employees require money for doing the job of talking to people and signing documents, banks in recent times have been using machines such as ATMs and web servers that do the job of interacting with customers instead of paid bank employees. The task of these machines is to learn what each customer wants to do with their money and, to the extent that it is possible, act on what the customer wants (for example, ATMs can hand out cash). Customers can always know how much money they have in their accounts, and they are confident that the numbers they see in their bank statements and on their computer screens accurately reflect the number of dollars that they can get from the bank on demand. They can be so sure of this that they can accept those numbers in the same way they accept paper banknotes (this is similar to the way people started accepting paper dollars when they had been accepting gold or silver).
Such a system has several disadvantages:

Bitcoin is a system of owning and voluntarily transferring amounts of so-called bitcoins, in a manner similar to an on-line banking, but pseudonymously and without reliance on a central authority to maintain account balances. If bitcoins are valuable, it is because they are useful and limited in supply.
The creation of coins must be limited for the currency to have any value.
New coins are slowly mined into existence by following a mutually agreed-upon set of rules. A user mining bitcoins is running a software program that searches tirelessly for a solution to a very difficult math problem whose difficulty is precisely known. The difficulty is automatically adjusted regularly so that the number of solutions found globally, by everyone, for a given unit of time is constant: an average of 6 per hour. When a solution is found, the user may tell everyone of the existence of this newly found solution, along with other information, packaged together in what is called a "block".
Blocks create 12.5 new bitcoins at present. This amount, known as the block reward, is an incentive for people to perform the computation work required for generating blocks. Every 210,000 new blocks generated (roughly every 4 years), the number of bitcoins that can be "mined" in a block reduces by 50%. Originally the block reward was 50 bitcoins; it halved in November 2012 and then once more in July 2016.  Any block that is created by a malicious user that does not follow this rule (or any other rules) will be rejected by everyone else. In the end, no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever exist.
Because the block reward will decrease over the long term, miners will some day instead pay for their hardware and electricity costs by collecting transaction fees. The sender of money may voluntarily pay a small transaction fee which will be kept by whoever finds the next block. Paying this fee will encourage miners to include the transaction in a block more quickly.
To guarantee that a third-party, let's call her Eve, cannot spend other people's bitcoins by creating transactions in their names, Bitcoin uses public key cryptography to make and verify digital signatures. In this system, each person, such as Alice or Bob, has one or more addresses each with an associated pair of public and private keys that they may hold in a wallet. Only the user with the private key can sign a transaction to give some of their bitcoins to somebody else, but anyone can validate the signature using that user’s public key.
Suppose Alice wants to send a bitcoin to Bob.
(Only the first two steps require human action. The rest is done by the Bitcoin client software.)
Looking at this transaction from the outside, anyone who knows that these addresses belong to Alice and Bob can see that Alice has agreed to transfer the amount to Bob, because nobody else has Alice's private key. Alice would be foolish to give her private key to other people, as this would allow them to sign transactions in her name, removing funds from her control.
Later on, when Bob wishes to transfer the same bitcoins to Charlie, he will do the same thing:
Only Bob can do this because only he has the private key that can create a valid signature for the transaction.
Eve cannot change whose coins these are by replacing Bob’s address with her address, because Alice signed the transfer to Bob using her own private key, which is kept secret from Eve, and instructing that the coins which were hers now belong to Bob. So if Charlie accepts that the original coin was in the hands of Alice, he will also accept the fact that this coin was later passed to Bob, and now Bob is passing this same coin to him.
The process described above does not prevent Alice from using the same bitcoins in more than one transaction. The following process does; this is the primary innovation behind Bitcoin.
When Bob sees that his transaction has been included in a block, which has been made part of the single longest and fastest-growing blockchain (extended with significant computational effort), he can be confident that the transaction by Alice has been accepted by the computers in the network and is permanently recorded, preventing Alice from creating a second transaction with the same coin. In order for Alice to thwart this system and double-spend her coins, she would need to muster more computing power than all other Bitcoin users combined.
When it comes to the Bitcoin network itself, there are no "accounts" to set up, and no e-mail addresses, user-names or passwords are required to hold or spend bitcoins. Each balance is simply associated with an address and its public-private key pair. The money "belongs" to anyone who has the private key and can sign transactions with it. Moreover, those keys do not have to be registered anywhere in advance, as they are only used when required for a transaction. Transacting parties do not need to know each other's identity in the same way that a store owner does not know a cash-paying customer's name.
A Bitcoin address mathematically corresponds to a public key and looks like this:
Each person can have many such addresses, each with its own balance, which makes it very difficult to know which person owns what amount. In order to protect his privacy, Bob can generate a new public-private key pair for each individual receiving transaction and the Bitcoin software encourages this behavior by default. Continuing the example from above, when Charlie receives the bitcoins from Bob, Charlie will not be able to identify who owned the bitcoins before Bob.
Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a protocol, capitalization can be confusing. Accepted practice is to use Bitcoin (singular with an upper case letter B) to label the protocol, software, and community, and bitcoins (with a lower case b) to label units of the currency.
You can directly explore the system in action by visiting Biteasy.com, Blockchain.info, Blokr.io Bitcoin Block Explorer or Bitcoin Block Explorer. This last site will show the latest blocks in the blockchain. The blockchain contains the agreed history of all transactions that took place in the system. Note how many blocks were generated in the last hour, which on average will be 6. Also notice the number of transactions; in just one hour there are between 6000 to 7000 transactions. This indicates how active the system currently is.
Next, navigate to one of these blocks. The block's hash begins with a run of zeros. This is what made creating the block so difficult; a hash that begins with many zeros is much more difficult to find than a hash with few or no zeros. The computer that generated this block had to try many Nonce values (also listed on the block's page) until it found one that generated this run of zeros. Next, see the line titled Previous block. Each block contains the hash of the block that came before it. This is what forms the chain of blocks. Now take a look at all the transactions the block contains. The first transaction is the income earned by the computer that generated this block. It includes a fixed amount of coins created out of "thin air" and possibly a fee collected from other transactions in the same block.
Drill down into any of the transactions and you will see how it is made up of one or more amounts coming in and out. Having more than one incoming and outgoing amount in a transaction enables the system to join and break amounts in any possible way, allowing for any fractional amount needed. Each incoming amount is a past transaction (which you can also view) from someone's address, and each outgoing amount is addressed to someone and will be part of a future transaction (which you can also navigate down into if it has already taken place.)
Finally you can follow any of the addresses links and see what public information is available for them.
To get an impression of the amount of activity on the Bitcoin network, you might like to visit the monitoring websites Bitcoin Monitor and Bitcoin Watch. The first shows a real-time visualization of events on the Bitcoin network, and the second lists general statistics on the amount and size of recent transactions.
This is quite a difficult question to answer accurately. One approach is to count how many bitcoin clients connected to the network in the last 24 hours. We can do this because some clients transmit their addresses to the other members of the network periodically. In September 2011 this method suggested that there were about 60,000 users.
Bitcoin WhitePaper (WP) is a document that helps your prospective customer make an informed decision in favor of your company or a specific product. If the document does not facilitate a decision, it may be anything but not WP. Speaking in the most understandable language, white paper is something between an article and an advertising brochure. The document contains quite useful information and at the same time leads to the fact that the best solution is to purchase a certain product or service.

The Ethereum network may compete with these alternative Ethereum-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Ethereum Platform and ETH.It is possible that the Ethereum Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ethereum Platform and potential uses of ETH.  It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.The User recognizes that the Ethereum Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Ethereum Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Ethereum Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Ethereum Platform.The Ethereum Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Ethereum Stiftung or the Ethereum Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Stiftung Ethereum, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ethereum Platform causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Ethereum Platform.Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Stiftung Ethereum intends to update the protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to:Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum Stiftung and Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for ETH could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can create new ETH tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Instability in the demand of for ETH may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Ethereum based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation.If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy.Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities

This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.The project was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected.On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work.The  Ethereum Wallet  is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to hold and secure ether and other crypto-assets built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.Create a tradeable digital token that can be used as a currency, a representation of an asset, a virtual share, a proof of membership or anything at all. These tokens use a standard coin API so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard. The total amount of tokens in circulation can be set to a simple fixed amount or fluctuate based on any programmed ruleset.Do you already have ideas that you want to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don’t trust?Using Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned back to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearinghouse or having to trust anyone.You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.Now that you have developed your idea and secured funds, what’s next? You have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run board meetings and do a bunch of paperwork. Or you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from your backers and submit them through a completely transparent voting process.One of the many advantages of having a robot run your organization is that it is immune to any outside influence as it’s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. And because the Ethereum network is decentralized, you'll be able to provide services with a 100% uptime guarantee. Now it's your turn: start building what you dream of creating in Ethereum! Could your business be enhanced by operating on a cryptographically secure, decentralized, tamper-proof network?Check out the many great projects* already being built on Ethereum.

It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Ethereum also provides a cryptocurrency token called "ether", which can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.[1] "Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.
As an open source platform, Ethereum greatly simplifies the implementation of blockchain technology, which explains the interest of not only new startups, but also major SOFTWARE developers, such as Microsoft, IBM and Acronis. Also conventional companies such as VTB banks, Sberbank, Lufthansa and S7 airlines, as well as international charitable organizations showed interest in the platform.
Ethereum was proposed in late 2013 by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. Development was funded by an online crowdsale between July and August 2014. The system went live on 30 July 2015, with 11.9 million coins "premined" for the crowdsale. This accounts for approximately 13 percent of the total circulating supply.
In 2016, as a result of the collapse of The DAO project, Ethereum was forked into two separate blockchains - the new forked version became Ethereum (ETH), and the original continued as Ethereum Classic (ETC).[2]
Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a programmer involved with Bitcoin Magazine, in late 2013 with a goal of building decentralized applications. Buterin had argued that Bitcoin needed a scripting language for application development. Failing to gain agreement, he proposed development of a new platform with a more general scripting language.

At the time of public announcement in January 2014, the core Ethereum team was Vitalik Buterin, Mihai Alisie, Anthony Di Iorio, and Charles Hoskinson.[3] Formal development of the Ethereum software project began in early 2014 through a Swiss company, Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (EthSuisse). Subsequently, a Swiss non-profit foundation, the Ethereum Foundation (Stiftung Ethereum), was created as well. Development was funded by an online public crowdsale during July–August 2014, with the participants buying the Ethereum value token (ether) with another digital currency, bitcoin. While there was early praise for the technical innovations of Ethereum, questions were also raised about its security and scalability.
Several codenamed prototypes of the Ethereum platform were developed by the Foundation, as part of their Proof-of-Concept series, prior to the official launch of the Frontier network.
"Olympic" was the last of these prototypes, and public beta pre-release. The Olympic network provided users with a bug bounty of 25,000 ether for stress testing the limits of the Ethereum blockchain.
"Frontier" marked the tentative experimental release of the Ethereum platform in July 2015.[4]
Since the initial launch, Ethereum has undergone several planned protocol upgrades called milestones, which are important changes affecting the underlying functionality and/or incentive structures of the platform.
"Homestead" is the current milestone, and is considered stable. It includes improvements to transaction processing, gas pricing, and security.
There are at least two other protocol upgrades planned in the future:
"Metropolis" is intended to reduce the complexity of the EVM and provide more flexibility for smart contract developers. Metropolis also adds supports for zkSnarks (from Zcash); with the first zksnarks transaction occurring on testnet on September 19, 2017.
"Serenity" should include a fundamental change to Ethereum's consensus algorithm to enable a basic transition from hardware mining (proof-of-work) to virtual mining (proof-of-stake). Improvements to scalability, specifically sharding, are also said to be a key objective on the development roadmap.[5]
Ethereum was originally described in one of Buterin's publications at the end of 2013. In April 2014, Ethereum was formally described by Gavin wood in the so-called "yellow book". Around the same time, Ethereum was informally described as a "next generation Bitcoin" (or "Bitcoin 2.0") platform.
In the second half of 2014 fund raising for development started through crowdfunding. Ethereum was the first cryptocurrency to use an Initial Coin Offering for their crowd funding. The Ethereum presale took place from Tuesday, 22 July 2014 to Tuesday, 2 September 2014, a total of 42 days. 31,500 bitcoins or equivalently $18.4 million USD was raised.[6] After that, Ethereum drew the attention of many banks as a testing platform for studying smart contracts and bonds. The Ethereum blockchain platform was launched on the 30th of July 2015.
On March 14, 2016, Ethereum released an early alpha version of Frontier in which developers did not guarantee security. The new version of the Protocol is called Homestead and also refers to the early, but already stable version.
Securing the network with hashing is assumed only at the initial stage. In the future Ethereum plans to complete the transition to the method of protection proof-of-stake with a hybrid model at the intermediate stage. Despite this, there is protection against the creation of ASIC due to the high requirements for video memory GPU, which is constantly growing (2.04 GB in July 2017).
In June 2016, an error was detected in the software code of the DAO, a platform for Autonomous investment capital management. On June 16, this vulnerability allowed unknown people to move about one-third of the ether available in The DAO (at that time in the amount of 50 million US dollars) to one of ChildDAO, which was controlled only by the attacking party. However, due to the peculiarities of the implementation of the DAO, these funds were not available for withdrawal within a month.
The Ethereum community discussed whether to return the ether to investors and in what way to implement the return, and the developers of the DAO from Germany tried to counter attack the hacker, since the decentralized nature of the DAO and Ethereum means the absence of a Central body that could take a quick action and require user consensus. After a few weeks of discussion, on July 20, 2016, a hard fork was produced in the Ethereum blockchain, to reverse the hacking and return to investors the funds stolen from the DAO. This was the first branch of the chain of blocks to return stolen funds to investors.
As a result of rejection of transaction history rollback and rule changes by a part of the community, Ethereum Classic was formed, which continues to work as a project "the DAO".
After the hard fork related to The DAO, Ethereum subsequently forked twice in the fourth quarter of 2016 to deal with other attacks. By the end of November 2016, Ethereum had increased its DDoS protection, de-bloated the blockchain, and thwarted further spam attacks by hackers.
The value token of the Ethereum blockchain is called ether. It is listed under the code ETH and traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. It is also used to pay for transaction fees and computational services on the Ethereum network.
Tokens can be volatile per circumstances, such as ether's plunge from $21.50 to $8 when The DAO was hacked on 17 June 2016. As of June 2017, the value of ether had risen to more than $400, a 5,000% rise since the beginning of the year.[7]
Price volatility on any single exchange can exceed the volatility on Ether token prices more generally.  A "flash crash" triggered by a large sell order on one exchange briefly dropped the price on that exchange to $0.10 as every offer to buy was absorbed, after which the price quickly recovered to more than $300.
The ERC-20 standard protocol is a technical standard for smart contracts on Ethereum. It defines a set of rules to be followed in the creation of new tokens on the blockchain, allowing for exchanges and wallets to better (more seamlessly) integrate new tokens that follow the standard. Most major tokens on the Ethereum blockchain are ERC-20 compliant.[8]
The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)[9] is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. The formal definition of the EVM is specified in the Ethereum Yellow Paper, original version by Gavin Wood. It is sandboxed and also completely isolated from the network, filesystem or other processes of the host computer system. Every Ethereum node in the network runs an EVM implementation and executes the same instructions. Ethereum Virtual Machines have been implemented in C++, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, and WebAssembly (currently under development).
Smart contracts are deterministic exchange mechanisms controlled by digital means that can carry out the direct transaction of value between untrusted agents. They can be used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation or performance of procedural instructions and potentially circumvent censorship, collusion, and counter-party risk. In Ethereum, smart contracts are treated as autonomous scripts or stateful decentralized applications that are stored in the Ethereum blockchain for later execution by the EVM.
Instructions embedded in Ethereum contracts are paid for in ether (or more technically "gas") and can be implemented in a variety of Turing complete scripting languages.
As the contracts can be public, it opens up the possibility to prove functionality, e.g. self-contained provably fair casinos.
One issue related to using smart contracts on a public blockchain is that bugs, including security holes, are visible to all but cannot be fixed quickly.[10] One example of this is the 17 June 2016 attack on The DAO, which could not be quickly stopped or reversed.
There is ongoing research on how to use formal verification to express and prove non-trivial properties. A Microsoft Research report noted that writing solid smart contracts can be extremely difficult in practice, using The DAO hack to illustrate this problem. The report discussed tools that Microsoft had developed for verifying contracts, and noted that a large-scale analysis of published contracts is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities. The report also stated that it is possible to verify the equivalence of a Solidity program and the EVM code.
Smart contracts are high-level programming abstractions that are compiled down to EVM bytecode and deployed to the Ethereum blockchain for execution. They can be written in Solidity (a language library with similarities to C and JavaScript), Serpent (similar to Python), LLL (a low-level Lisp-like language), and Mutan (Go-based, but deprecated). There is also a research-oriented language under development called Viper (a strongly-typed Python-derived decidable language).
In Ethereum all smart contracts are stored publicly on every node of the blockchain, which has trade-offs.[11] The downside is that performance issues arise in that every node is calculating all the smart contracts in real time, resulting in lower speeds. Ethereum engineers have been working on sharding the calculations, but no solution had been detailed by early 2016. As of January 2016, the Ethereum protocol could process 25 transactions per second.[11] In September 2016, Buterin presented proposals to increase scalability. Buterin and Joseph Poon (a co-author of Bitcoin's lightning network whitepaper) announced in 2017 their plan to launch a scaling solution called Plasma which creates "child" blockchains to the "main" parent blockchain.[12] The plasma project is not without skeptics, specifically Vlad Zamfir (Ethereum's lead researcher on proof of stake) has publicly questioned the plasma project's viability.
The supply of Ether was projected to increase by 14.75% in 2017, with an algorithm in place to gradually decline to 1.59% by 2065. However, a new implementation of Ethereum named "Casper" based on proof-of-stake rather than proof-of-work is expected to reduce the inflation rate to between 0.5% to 2%.
Many uses have been proposed for Ethereum platform, including ones that are impossible or unfeasible. Use case proposals have included finance, the internet-of-things, farm-to-table produce, electricity sourcing and pricing, and sports betting. Ethereum is (as of 2017) the leading blockchain platform for initial coin offering projects, with over 50% market share.[13]
The projects listed in this section are not exhaustive and may be outdated.
These cryptocurrency wallets support Ethereum:
Ethereum-based customized software and networks, independent from the public Ethereum chain, are being tested by enterprise software companies. Interested parties include Microsoft, IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Deloitte, R3, Innovate UK (cross-border payments prototype).
In March 2017, various blockchain start-ups, research groups, and Fortune 500 companies announced the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) with 30 founding members.[16]
By May, the nonprofit organization had 116 enterprise members—including ConsenSys, CME Group, Cornell University's research group, Toyota Research Institute, Samsung SDS, Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan, Cooley LLP, Merck KGaA, Deloitte, Accenture, Banco Santander, BNY Mellon, ING Group, and National Bank of Canada.
The purpose of the EEA is to coordinate the engineering of an open-source reference standard and private "permissioned" version of the Ethereum blockchain that can address the common interests of enterprises in banking, management, consulting, automotive, pharmaceutical, health, technology, mobile, entertainment, and other industries, while working with developers from the Ethereum ecosystem. Certain members of the alliance have also indicated a desire to investigate and collaborate on hybrid architectures to potentially anchor private blockchains to the public Ethereum blockchain in the future, although concerns remain over the security, compliance, and regulations involved in bridging such permissioned and "permissionless" blockchains.
By July 2017, there were over 150 members in the alliance, including recent additions MasterCard, Cisco Systems, and Scotiabank.[17] (Mastercard wanted their name excluded from the press release.[18])
Ethereum-based permissioned blockchain variants are used and being investigated for various projects.
Ethereum technology makes it possible to register any transactions with any assets on the basis of a distributed base of contracts such as blockchain, without resorting to traditional legal procedures. This possibility is competitive in relation to the existing system of registration of transactions. According to the Economist, the technology of "smart contracts" marks a new era in financial technology.
Bacchanalia technologies can be successfully combined with the remote banking services of the type provided through SMS messages. Due to its low cost, this opportunity is particularly attractive for developing countries, according to The Economist.
Smart contracts in Ethereum are presented in the form of classes that can be implemented in various languages, including visual programming and compiled to bytecode for a virtual machine Ethereum (Ethereum Virtual Machine, EVM) before sending it to the blockchain. The state change of the virtual machine can be recorded in the full Turing scripting language.
Unlike the scripting language in the bitcoin Protocol, EVMS support loops, so the platform uses a mechanism called gas to limit contracts that can take a long time to execute.
Dan Boneh of Stanford and Vipul Goyal  of Carnegie Mellon told CNBC that some of their respective students are starting their own cryptocurrency projects. Cornell University, UC Berkeley, and Technion – Israel Institute of Technology formed the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (aka IC3) and that entity joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.
A finance blogger on FT Alphaville has pointed out that criminals are using Ethereum to run Ponzi schemes and other forms of investment fraud. The article was based on a paper from the University of Cagliari, which placed the number of Ethereum smart contracts which facilitate Ponzi schemes at nearly 10% of 1384  smart contracts examined. However, it also estimated that only 0.05% of the transactions on the network were related to such contracts.
CBS noted in 2017 that price hikes in Ethereum, (as well as Litecoin and Bitcoin),  are creating most of the excitement, rather than technology.

Ripple is a system of the real time gross settlements (RTGS), exchange and money transfer system. Another name is Ripple transaction protocol (RTXP), or Ripple protocol. It is built upon a distributed open Internet protocol, consensus ledger and its own currency called XRP.
Ripple was first implemented in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, a Web developer in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. In 2005, Fugger began to build Ripplepay as a financial service to provide secure payment options to members of an online community via a global network. On the basis of this protocol, a new digital currency system appeared in May 2011, for which its own crypto currency XRP was issued.
This led to the development of a new Ripple system in 2011 by Jed McCaleb. It was designed to eliminate Bitcoin's reliance on centralized exchanges, use less electricity than Bitcoin, and perform transactions much more quickly than Bitcoin.
The Ripple protocol was launched in 2012, its main goal is to ensure “secure, instant and almost free global money operations of any size without any chargebacks”. The protocol supports payment with fiat currency, crypto currency, goods or any other units like passenger bonus miles or mobile minutes.
As the transactions in this system are confirmed by the consensus of network participants instead of mining like in the Bitcoin network, it causes more trust of banks and payment networks. For example, the Ripple protocol is used by the Earthport service payment system, which is working in 65 countries, including the Bank of America and the HSBC bank.
Today, XRP is amongst the largest crypto currencies in the capitalization.
In Ripple, users make payments between themselves by using cryptographically signed transactions denominated in arbitrary real-world assets (dollars, gold, airmiles etc). To this end, Ripple keeps a ledger which records debts between users that trust each other. In this way, all assets are represented as debt. When a payment is made between two users that trust each other, the balance of the mutual credit line is adjusted, subject to limits set by each user. In order to send assets between users that have not directly established a trust relationship, the system tries to find a path between the two users such that each link of the path is between two users that do have a trust relationship. All balances along the path are then adjusted simultaneously and  atomically.
The Ripple protocol is based on an open shared database or ledger using the consensus process, which allows making payments, exchange or transfers of money in a distributed process.
In Ripple, users conduct transactions through cryptographically signed deals, nominated in a hard currency or XRP. In the latter case, Ripple may use an internal ledger, while for payments in other assets, the Ripple ledger only keeps records – puts down the amounts owed according to the debt obligations.
To let a deal happen, two participants are needed: a regulated financial institution, where the clients’ money is kept, and hedge foundations or currency trading desks that provide liquidity that they want to trade in.
To confirm a transaction, Ripple users have to specify other users whom they trust, and the amount. If there are no direct trust-based relations between users, the system searches for additional elements.
The Ripple digital currency system confirms transactions not with mining, but with a consensus of the network participants. Such approach eliminates the dependence on centralized exchanges that are used in Bitcoin. Ripple also uses less electric power than Bitcoin while deals are carried out much faster.
The XRP crypto currency exists only in the Ripple system. One XRP consists of a million of units called drops. At the beginning of the work of Ripple, 100 billion of XRP were issued and the protocol rules prohibit new emissions.
At that, the users of the Ripple network don’t have to keep funds in XRP specifically; they can choose any other currency (that will be considered a debt instrument within the network). XRP is also used as a transitional currency for deals where a direct exchange between two other currencies is not available.
Today, XRP is on the 5th place in the capitalization of crypto currencies, yielding to Bitcoin, Ether, Bitcoin cash and IOTA. One XRP as of the beginning of October 2017 costs about $0.23.

.I Bitcoin Cash 
                            Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash
                        FastTransact in seconds. Get confirmed in minutes.ReliableA network that runs without congestion.Low FeesSend money globally for pennies.SimpleEasy to use. No hassles.StableA payment system that's a proven store of value.SecureWorld's most robust blockchain technology.Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.All Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 are also owners of Bitcoin Cash. All are welcome to join the Bitcoin Cash community as we move forward in creating sound money accessible to the whole world.The Bitcoin Cash network will undergo a protocol upgrade on May 15th 2018. Businesses and individuals who use the Bitcoin Cash network should check to ensure that their software is compatible with the upgrade. A specification is available, and the upgrade is being tested on testnet. This upgrade is the first of planned series of protocol upgrades announced late 2017 by several developer groups.On Chain Scalability - Bitcoin Cash follows the Nakamoto roadmap of global adoption with on-chain scaling. As a first step, the blocksize limit has been made adjustable, with an increased default of 8MB. Research is underway to allow massive future increases.New Transaction Signatures - A new SigHash type provides replay protection, improved hardware wallet security, and elimination of the quadratic hashing problem.New Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) - Responsive Proof-of-Work difficulty adjustment allows miners to migrate from the legacy Bitcoin chain as desired, while providing protection against hashrate fluctuations.Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. The bitcoin-ml mailing list is a good venue for making proposals for changes that require coordination across development teams. Workgroups have been set up to assist developers to coordinate and seek peer-review. For those wishing to implement changes to the Bitcoin Cash protocol, it is recommended to seek early peer-review and engage collaboratively with other developers through the workgroups.What is Bitcoin Cash?Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.Is Bitcoin Cash different from 'Bitcoin'?Yes. Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer digital cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.If I own Bitcoin, do I automatically own Bitcoin Cash too?Anyone who held Bitcoin at the time Bitcoin Cash was created became owners of Bitcoin Cash. This means that Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 (August 1st, 2017 about 13:16 UTC) have the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as they had Bitcoin at that time. If your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your Bitcoin Cash.Any transactions after the August 1st ledger split are completely separate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This means any Bitcoin acquired after the split does not include any Bitcoin Cash, and any Bitcoin Cash does not include any Bitcoin.How is transaction replay being handled between the new and the old blockchain?Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new signature hashing algorithm indicated by the flag SIGHASH_FORKID. These signatures are not valid on the Bitcoin Legacy network. This prevents Bitcoin Cash transactions from being replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.Why was a fork necessary to create Bitcoin Cash?The legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block, or about 3 transactions per second. Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.Was the 1 MB block size limit causing problems for Bitcoin?Yes, in 2017, capacity hit the 'invisible wall'. Fees skyrocketed, and Bitcoin became unreliable, with some users unable to get their transactions confirmed, even after days of waiting.Bitcoin's market price has increased, but its growth and usefulness as a currency has stagnated. Many users, merchants, businesses and even investors left Bitcoin for alternatives, causing its dominance to fall from 95% to as low as 40%.Does Bitcoin Cash fix these problems?Yes. Bitcoin Cash immediately raised the block size limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. There is ample capacity for everyone's transactions.Low fees and fast confirmations have returned with Bitcoin Cash. The network is growing again. Users, merchants, businesses, and investors are building the future with real peer to peer cash.Why didn't Bitcoin raise the block size if it was easy?Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.Many miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected.These two very different visions for Bitcoin are largely incompatible, which led to the community divide.Didn't SegWit increase the block capacity? Will Bitcoin Cash ever have SegWit?Segregated Witness or "SegWit" is an unacceptable substitute for increasing the blocksize for several reasons.First, even if used in 100% of transactions, the increase would equate to 1.7MB blocks. Thus, it is a small capacity increase at best. It will not handle exponential growth or worldwide usage. Second, the soft fork implementation results in discardable signatures, which weakens Bitcoin's security model. Third, it makes future capacity increases more difficult due to bandwidth inefficiency and quadratic hashing attacks which SegWit doesn't solve since an attacker isn't forced to use it.For those (and other) reasons, Bitcoin Cash was necessary as a pre-SegWit fork. Segwit will not be adopted.Which Development Team is In Charge of Bitcoin Cash?Unlike the previous situation in Bitcoin, there is no one single development team for Bitcoin Cash. There are now multiple independent teams of developers.This decentralization of development (and decentralization of software implementations) is a much needed and important step forward.What is the ticker symbol for Bitcoin Cash?Bitcoin Cash is usually represented by the ticker symbol BCH.Bitcoin Cash is an upgraded version of the Bitcoin Core software. It increased the block size limit to 8mb in order to make transactions faster without needing expensive fees. Bitcoin Cash is both the name of the payment system and of its native cryptocurrency. It appeared on August 1st, 2017.[1]
Bitcoin Cash is the outcome of a long debate over Bitcoin Core's scalability problem. [2]
On the Bitcoin blockchain, blocks can carry a maximum of 1mb of transaction data. This limit was originally intended to prevent attacks where a massive bundle of transactions might be issued in order to weaken the network under its weight.[3] However, as the number of users on the network grew, the amount of transactions being broadcast to the network did as well, and maximum capacity was hit in 2017 at around 2,500 transactions per block. Since the network could only process 6 blocks per hour and the number of users kept growing, the constraints on block size resulted in delays. Transactions that were broadcast to the network were collected in the mempool, awaiting their turn to be confirmed by miners and placed into a block.[4] This resulted in a transaction fee market; users could pay high fees in order to get their transactions confirmed quicker. This made Bitcoin useless as a payment system for small amounts; a USD$3 transaction (to buy a cup of coffee, for example) might require a USD$15 fee.[3]
Two tentative solutions arose from the community: Bitcoin Unlimited and Segregated Witness.[3]
Bitcoin Unlimited would have eliminated block size limits. Detractors of this idea (many core developers among them) claimed this could lead to a centralization of the network by massive mining corporations, since individual miners would not be able to keep up with ever growing blocks.[3] Samson Mow, core developer and chief strategy officer at Blockstream, said that increasing the bock size would "(destroy) the Bitcoin ethos, which is open and permissionless, where nobody is telling you what to do.”[5]
SegWit, on the other hand, would have cut some of the blockchain's data out and stored it in external files. Detractors thought this option was merely buying time, and not a definite solution. They claimed that without a significant increase in block size, Bitcoin would never be on par with other payment systems like Visa and Paypal.[3]
In order to avoid a fork, the community compromised on a third option: SegWit2x. This would mean storing some data outside the blockchain as well as increasing the block size limit to 2mb.[3]
In May of 2017, many large Bitcoin companies agreed to install the SegWit software (created by core developers) in August, and to double the block size in later, in November. After some developers suggested the increase in size would never take place, a group of investors and entrepreneurs based in Asia, among them Roger Ver, announced the creation of a hard fork, called Bitcoin Cash.[5] The name was coined by the Chinese mining pool ViaBTC, whose primary investor was Bitmain, the then largest bitcoin mining operator in the world.[5][6]
The first implementation of the Bitcoin Cash protocol called Bitcoin ABC was revealed by Amaury "Deadal Nix" Séchet at the Future of Bitcoin conference in Arnhem, Netherlands. The Bitcoin Cash hard fork was announced to take place on August 1, 2017. It would increase the block size to 8mb.
BCH were distributed to all holders of BTC at the time of forking. That is, Bitcoin holders as of block 478558, the last common block (August 1st, 2017 about 13:16 UTC).[7]
Bitcoin Cash was initially traded at 0.5 BTC.
On August 9, it was 30% more profitable to mine on the original chain. Due to the new Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) algorithm used by Bitcoin Cash, mining difficulty has fluctuated rapidly, and the most profitable chain to mine has thus switched repeatedly between Bitcoin Cash and incumbent bitcoin. As both chains use the same proof-of-work algorithm, miners can easily move their hashpower between the two.  around 1,500 more blocks were mined on the Bitcoin Cash chain than on the original one attracted a significant proportion of total processing power.[8]
A fix for these difficulty/hashrate/profitability fluctuations was introduced on November 13, 2:06PM UTC. The EDA algorithm has been replaced with a new difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA) that hopes to prevent extreme fluctuations in difficulty while still allowing Bitcoin Cash to adapt to hashrate changes faster than incumbent bitcoin.
Since the Bitcoin owners before August 1st, 2017 have automatically become Bitcoin Cash owners, to prevent double expenses, the Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new algorithm of signature hashing, which isn’t valid in the Bitcoin Legacy network. It prevents repeated transactions of Bitcoin Cash in the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.
Bitcoin authors state that unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash doesn’t have a unified team of developers: instead of this, there are several independent groups. Such decentralization creates an additional protection degree. In prospect, the developers consider the possibility to increase the capacity of blocks even more.
Bitcoin Cash aims to "fulfill the original promise of Bitcoin as Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash" by giving users lower fees, more reliable confirmations and faster transactions.[9].
Eventually Bitcoin Cash was broadly adopted by digital currency exchanges. Exchanges such as Bitfinex, CEX.IO, ShapeShift and many others use the Bitcoin Cash name and the BCH ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency. Temporarily, Bitstamp and Bitfinex used the name Bcash, but after being criticized, they switched the name back to Bitcoin Cash.
Huobi exchange[10] uses the name Bitcoin Cash and the BCC ticker symbol.
While the alphanumeric address style is the same as the incumbent bitcoin (BTC), that Bitcoin Cash (BCH/BCC) should not be sent to a bitcoin (BTC) address. Like the incumbent bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash addresses can be used more than once, but should not be reused if privacy is a concern. However there are plans to change the address format.[11]
Cryptocurrency wallets such as the Ledger hardware wallet, KeepKey hardware wallet, Electron Cash software wallet, Bitcoin.com software wallet and many others use the name Bitcoin Cash for the cryptocurrency, using either BCH or BCC ticker symbol for it.
Trezor hardware wallet uses both Bitcoin Cash and Bcash cryptocurrency names. Its architect Marek "Slush" Palatinus explained: "The reason we prefer to use 'Bcash' is to protect users from using the wrong wallet by accident."[6]
Initially, Coinbase, one of the largest crypto currency exchanges stated that they are not going to work with Bitcoin Cash, however their opinion was changed later, and they promised to start supporting Bitcoin Cash transactions before January 1st, 2018. The exchanges Kraken, Bitfinex and Poloniex also announced their support of the new crypto currency. At the same time BitMEX, Exodus и Bitstamp spoke against Bitcoint Cash.
In October 2017, Bitmain, the largest manufacturer of mining equipment in China, which supplies about two thirds of the entire hash power in the Bitcoin network, announced that they are going to accept only Bitcoin Cash when selling the newest ASIC-miners. The reason lies in the economy:  the transaction fee of Bitcoin Cash is significantly lower than in other crypto currencies.
According to the analysts’ estimations, such decision may lead to the rate growth of the new currency.




.I EOS EOS.IO is software that introduces a blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved through an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built.
EOS is a new blockchain platform with the use of the delegated proof of stake (DPOS). It is launched by the Block.one Company registered in the Cayman Islands. At the moment, the project is going through the ICO stadium that will be completed in 2018. The project’s chief developer is Dan Larimer.
Project website
EOS ICO start date: 2017-06-26
EOS provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and/or clusters- The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that has the potential to scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications- Easy Upgrades and Bug Recovery- Low Latency
The project’s White Paper announces new EOS blockchain architecture intended for vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized apps. It is planned to implement the platform on the analogy of an operating system, on which the apps can be created. The software suggests login accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous connection and planning of apps on hundreds of cores or clusters of CPUs. As a result, a blockchain shall be created, which can be scaled to millions of transactions per second and allow expanding decentralized apps quickly and easily.
More information in the project whitepaper: https://github.com/EOSIO/Documentation/blob/master/TechnicalWhitePaper.md
The software of EOS.IO uses the decentralized consensus algorithm – delegated proof of stake (DPOS). According to this algorithm, the token holders in the blockchain with the use of the EOS software choose the block creators through the continuous approval system and every network participant can take part in the creation of blocks proportionally to the VOTES received. For a private blockchain, the management can use tokens for adding and removing the IT staff.
The Block.one Company creates the EOS.IO software, but doesn’t plan to launch any public platform with the use of it. Any launch of the EOS platform will be carried out by the community participants that are not connected with Block.one. The third parties launching the EOS platform can delete, change or complete the EOS.IO software before, during and after the launch of the EOS platform.
EOS tokens are distributed on the Ethereum platform since June 26th, 2017. The process will last over 341 days in several steps; in total, it is planned to distribute 1 billion tokens. The first step took place from June 26th to July 1st, 2017. Other 700 million tokens are distributed by 2 million tokens during 350 short periods of 23 hours each. The remaining 100 million tokens, or a tenth of the total amount, will be reserved for Block.one and cannot be sold or transferred to Ethereum networks.
At the end of each period, the whole amount of tokens reserved for it is distributed among the EOS ICO participants proportionally to the amount of ether that each of them invested in this period.
EOS tokens have no rights or functional capabilities, including the EOS platform.
During the first step of the EOS ICO, the startup managed to collect $170 million despite the critics from some representatives of the blockchain community. The main object of critics became Dan Larimer, the EOS developer. Earlier he launched 2 platforms, Bishares and Steemit, which allowed their users to create tokens in unlimited qualities. The absence of the project’s detailed technical description is also questionable: for now, everything is limited to the general words “White Paper”.
As a result, the capitalization of the issued EOS tokens from summer to autumn 2017 was reduced for 45%. As of October 19th, one token costs $0.57 with the market capitalization of $236.4 million, while the volume of the attracted funds at that moment made out $400 million.
At that, the management of Block.one stated at the beginning of October that according to the results of the whole ICO, the company will manage to attract $1 billion for the project implementation by the middle of 2018.
EOS market cap on 6 APR 2018: $4,588,080,009

Litecoin (LTC) is a decentralized cryptocurrency, a fork of Bitcoin intended by its designers to be more feasibly mined using consumer-grade hardware.
Litecoin is a peer-to-peer crypto currency that was developed on the base of Bitcoin and has an open source code. Unlike Bitcoin, the Litecoin blockchain is able to process a greater number of transactions.
Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on October 7, 2011 by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee.[1] The Litecoin network went live on October 13, 2011. It was a fork of the Bitcoin Core client, differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time (2.5 minutes), increased maximum number of coins, different hashing algorithm (scrypt), instead of SHA-256), and a slightly modified GUI.[2]
During the month of November 2013, the aggregate value of Litecoin experienced massive growth which included a 100% leap within 24 hours.
Litecoin reached a $1 billion market capitalization in November 2013. By late November 2017, its market capitalization was US $4,600,081,733 ($85.18 per coin).[3]
In May 2017, Litecoin became the first of the top-5 (by market cap) cryptocurrencies to adopt Segregated Witness. Later in May of the same year, the first Lightning Network transaction was completed through Litecoin, transferring 0.00000001 LTC from Zürich to San Francisco in under one second.
The creator of Litecoin – Charlie Lee, a former employee of Google – took the Bitcoin source code as a basis and created a crypto currency that needs 2.5 minutes to generate a block – this is 4 times faster than Bitcoin[4] .
The full emission of Litecoin makes out 84 million coins, which is also 4 times more than of Bitcoin. The start reward for a block made out 50 Litecoins, and now it is 25 Litecoins. The Litecoin generation speed reduces twice for every 840, 000 blocks. It is supposed that about ¾ Litecoins will be generated by 2020.
Litecoin uses the Scrypt hashing algorithm. The equipment for using this algorithm is more expensive than on SHA-256, which is used by Bitcoin. As the process requires more memory, graphics processors suit better for the Litecoin mining.
The Litecoin cryptocurrency was initially created as a more perfect alternative of Bitcoin. Now Litecoins are called “silver coins” on the analogy of “golden” Bitcoin, and in 2017, Litecoin showed even a bigger growth, which hit upon the prohibitive decision of the Chinese government.
Today, it came out from the five of the largest crypto currencies on the market capitalization level and takes the sixth place with the capitalization of 2.786 billion dollars.
At that, the popularity of Litecoins remains in place. In October 2017, the Waves Platform announced the opening of a gateway for Litecoin, which made the crypto currency available for use within its own network.
Heavily based on Bitcoin this coin is almost identical to it, although it has some key differences:
Thus Scrypt algorithm strips any FPGA, GPU and ASIC users of their advantage over CPU miners and as such is very suitable for the intended purpose of allowing an even distribution of Litecoin mining capacity between network users. Unfortunately with rising popularity of the currency now there are ASICs for Litecoin mining in development nevertheless.
Other cryptocurrencies are experimenting on much heavier hashing algorithms to remain ASIC-resistant.
Litecoin is different in some ways from Bitcoin.
Due to Litecoin's use of the scrypt algorithm, FPGA and ASIC devices made for mining Litecoin are more complicated to create and more expensive to produce than they are for Bitcoin, which uses SHA-256.[5]

All Rights Reserved.Cardano is a decentralized block platform on opensource smart contracts, launched in September 2017 by Blockchain Development Output Hong Kong (IOHK). On the basis of the Cardano platform, the cryptocurrency ADA is working. It is in the development process, but not long ago, the cryptocurrency was added to the central wallet.

Cardano is developed by the team headed by Charles Hoskinson, the former cofounder of BitShares and Ethereum, and is aimed at the launch of smart contracts, decentralized apps, sidechains, multipart calculations and metadata.
The platform works on the Proof-of-Stake algorithm called Ouroboros that determines how separate nodes achieve consensus in relation to the entire network. The algorithm is an important part of the infrastructure that supports the cryptocurrency ADA. According to the developers, the security level of Ouroboros is comparable with the level of Bitcoin blockchain. This is the first algorithm that passed the reviewing on the status cryptographic conference Crypto 2017.
The cryptocurrency ADA has grown by 1500% since September 2017. Now, it is on the 6. place among the cryptocurrencies by the market capitalization – over $7.9 million (the data by CoinMarketCap.com, March 5th, 2018). In the trading 25 927 070 538 coins of 31 112 483 745 issued take part with the final emission of 45 billion coins.


Until March 2018, the only cryptocurrency wallet with ADA support was the wallet Daedalus. It is available for Windows and Mac with basic functions; the release of a Linux version is also planned. The wallet supports other currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic.
In the beginning of March it was known that ADA added the cryptowallet Centra. For the cryptocurrency this means that it can be used now with the Centra card that had an access to 36 million terminals around the world.
Although the rate of ADA has become a little lower than its peak price in the beginning of 2018, the credit of trust from the part of such a big cryptomarket player as Centra may become a source for the new growth, as it is supposed by the analysts. An important step for this will become the full-fledged network launch, planned for the nearest future.

Stellar Build Challenge #6 – the Results
 
        Stellar.org is a nonprofit organization.© 2014-2018 Stellar Development FoundationStellar is the platform for foreign exchange transactions operating in real time. It was founded in early 2014 by jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim as a branch of the Ripple system and first worked on the eponymous Protocol. In the future, it developed its own open-source Protocol Stellar. In the process of using its own kind of electronic currency, which was previously called the rack or the star, and now called the lumen.
To support the platform was organized non-profit non-stock Fund Stellar Development Foundation . The Fund was derived from the company Striperuen[1].
The updated Stellar network (on its own Protocol) was launched in November 2015. And at the time of the first release in the summer of 2014, and during 2015, Stellar received benevolent reviews in the press.
In October 2017, the company announced cooperation with IBM.

Stellar is an open-source protocol for value exchange. It was founded in early 2014 by Jed Mccaleb and Joyce Kim[2].The Stellar protocol is supported by a nonprofit, the Stellar Development Foundation. The Foundation’s mission is to expand financial access and literacy worldwide.
At launch, Stellar was based on the Ripple. After systemic problems with the existing consensus algorithm were discovered, Stellar created an updated version of the protocol with a new consensus algorithm. The code and whitepaper for this new algorithm were released in April 2015. [3]
The servers perform a software implementation of the Protocol and use the Internet to connect and communicate with other Stellar servers, forming a global currency exchange network. Each server keeps records of all "accounts" in the network. These records are stored in a database called Ledger. Servers declare changes in the Ledger, offering "deals" that transfer accounts from one state to another, spending the balance of the account or changing its properties. All servers are trying to come to an agreement that will apply to the current Ledger some package deals, through a process called "consensus"[4].
The Consensus process runs at regular intervals, usually every 2-4 seconds. This keeps a copy of each server's Ledger in a synchronized and identical state. When you start Stellar was based on the Protocol Rippleruen. After system problems related to the existing consensus algorithm were discovered, Stellar created an updated version of the Protocol with a new consensus algorithm based on a completely new code. The code and technical documentation for this new algorithm was released in April 2015, and the updated network began operating in November 2015.
When organizing the Stellar payment network, actions were taken and rules were adopted, which should help to avoid the problems inherent in the Ripple network.
We can say that the organizers of the Stellar platform have done everything possible to exclude any gambling component from this project.
Joyce Kim was a VC at Freestyle Capital and an entrepreneur. Prior to that, she was an attorney at Wilmer Hale and Sherman & Sterling and pro bono at Sanctuary for Families and the Innocence Project. Joyce graduated from Cornell University at the age of 19, followed by graduate school at Harvard and Columbia Law School. She is also a Director’s Fellow at the MIT Media Lab.
Joyce frequently speaks about tech nonprofits and the social potential of the Stellar network [6] .
Jed McCaleb is a co-founder of Stellar Development Foundation. In 2000, Jed created e-Donkey which became one of the largest file-sharing networks in its time. He later created Mt. Gox, the first bitcoin exchange, which was subsequently sold and re-coded by its current owners.
Jed has been quoted on the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) in publications like Wired and Coindesk

Using directed acyclic graph (DAG) technology instead of the traditional blockchain, IOTA's transactions are free regardless of the size of the transaction, confirmations times are fast, the number of transactions the system can handle simultaneously is unlimited, and the system can easily scale. IOTA was founded in 2015 by David Sonstebo, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Dr. Serguei Popov.
IOTA is overseen by the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit dedicated to developing the technology and maintaining it license-free for all developers to work with. The Foundation has established a collaboration with Volkswagen and Innogy to develop CarPass, an IOTA based technology that enables secure audit trails, digital identities, and charging networks for cars. With Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft, Fujitsu,and Samsung,the Foundation opened up a data marketplace using IOTA technology. The IOTA Foundation is also a founding member of the Trusted IOT Alliance, which includes the companies Bosch, ConsenSys, USbank, and Cisco. 
As of December 2017, the market capitalization of IOTA is $13 billion, making it the 4th largest cryptocurrency in circulation.
The smallest unit of account on IOTA is an Iota, after the smallest letter in the Greek alphabet. Larger unit names are created by adding metric system-like prefixes to the word Iota. Hence one million Iota are called a MegaIota or Miota (Mi), which is the base unit of Iota used for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. In order of size, unit names are:
Note that this is not to be confused with the binary prefix notation where 1 KiB is 1024 Bytes[1].
IOTA founded by David Sonstebo, Sergey Ivancheglo, Dominik Schiener, and Dr. Serguei Popov. The fixed supply of 2,779,530,283,277,761 Iota were created. As there is no mining, no more Iota will be created. A few months later, IOTA began open beta testing.
While beta testing continued, trading began over-the-counter between users for the next 11 months or so.
In May, IOTA announced a $10 million ecosystem fund to promote larger corporate collaborations, community projects, and developer acquisition initiatives. By June, IOTA was listed by its first exchange: Bitfinex Outlier Ventures, a venture capital firm, invested 7 figures into IOTA, their first direct investment into a distributed ledger technology. SatoshiPay announced a transition from the use of bitcoin to the use of IOTA as the transaction cost of bitcoins increase. 
By August, the IOTA Foundation forged a partnership with REFUNITE, the world's largest missing persons database, in order to use IOTA technology to help reunite families during and after conflicts. Additionally, IOTA's Flash Network (supporting extreme high speed, instantaneous nano payments) became active, ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum's versions. Monster Cleaning Services, a London UK based company, announced that they are accepting IOTA as a payment. Sopra Steria announced a partnership with IOTA to create a framework to optimize security between devices on the Internet of Things. 
In November, the IOTA Foundation was officially announced as a registered not-for-profit entity under German law. LATTICE80, a Singapore based Fintech hub and largest of its kind, cemented an agreement to open an IOTA innovation lab for the Internet of Things. Additionally, IOTA hired Cybercrypt ApS to develop IOTA's hash technology (Curl), to its next maturation phase.
Each square box in this diagram represents a transaction being sent.
For each new transaction, two random, unconfirmed transactions are validated in the tangle. Each validation (n) of a transaction increases the likelihood of a transaction being genuine, up to a threshold of (c). In this figure, red boxes indicate transactions where n > 0, but below a certain confirmation threshold, n < c.
The grey boxes represent transactions where n = 0. The green boxes represent transactions that have been validated a sufficient number of times, in order to be accepted as confirmed by the recipient address, n >= c.
]]
For an IOTA user to send out a transaction, the user must validate two other, randomly selected transactions. A sent transaction must accumulate a sufficient level of verification (i.e. must be validated a sufficient number of times by other users) in order to be accepted as “confirmed” by its recipient. IOTA works with a single administrator called the Coordinator which confirms all transactions in a set of released milestones. Without the Coordinator, the IOTA DAG is not considered sufficiently secured in its early stages. The Coordinator is meant to be removed when network is sufficiently large. Not only are hash-based signatures much faster than ECC, Grover's algorithm dictates that a quantum computer would be very efficient at conducting brute force attacks. The process of finding a cryptographic nonce in order to generate a Bitcoin block is particularly vulnerable to such brute-force attacks. As of today, an average of around 268 nonces must be checked to find a suitable hash, and this trends up over time. In this regard, IOTA is less susceptible to brute force attacks following implementation of quantum computing.
They made use of a self-designed hash function named Curl. In July 2017 researchers found a critical vulnerability allowing them to forge signatures. Generally, the researchers criticize the use of self-developed cryptography. On 7 August the developers replaced the hash function with a version of SHA-3 named Kerl, which works with ternary (instead of binary) operations, effectively fixing the vulnerability.
The IOTA Foundation was incorporated in Germany as a non-profit corporation that coordinates and funds development in the IOTA ecosystem. The Foundation is dedicated to building sustainable ecosystems around IOTA to accelerate its development and commercial adoption as an open-source technology. As of November 2017, the Foundation has a $100 million fund to promote IOTA use. The funds are distributed as IOTA tokens to companies building technology with IOTA. The development fund does not fund start ups.
The Foundation is the first regulated, non-profit in Germany ("gemeinnützige Stiftung") funded exclusively by cryptocurrencies. It's divided into a Board of Directors, Supervisory Board, and Advisory Board. Beneath them, the Foundation will organized into working groups focused on promoting and enabling IOTA's use in: Identity and MyDate; Social Causes; Supply Chain; Mobility; E-Health; Fintech; Smart Cities and Infrastructure; R&D; Interoperability; Energy; Industry 4.0; and Others.
IOTA launched a public marketplace (https://datum.iota.org/) for data generated by 3rd party sensors. The objective is to monetize the exploding market for 2.5 quintillion bytes of data being generated daily and growing exponentially. The project gathered participation of over twenty global organizations, including Deutsche Telekom, Bosch, Microsoft, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Airbus, Cisco, Samsung, Orange S.A., Fujitsu, and China's Huawei Group. Ordinary netizens will also be able to sell their data on the marketplace.
In September 2017, a distributed machine learning service was announced using IOTA as the payment system. CognIOTA goal is to allow users to rent their idle CPU's for others to use in real time. David Sonstebo commented, “The goal is indeed to get mining pools to switch over to providing a useful service (Machine Learning) while paid in iotas. A lot of mining farms are struggling these days, so this is a very win-win situation”
Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is a second layer data communication protocol which enables encrypted data streams, like RSS, to be sent securely over IOTA's distributed ledger. To transmit, a user needs to conduct a small amount of proof of work to prevent spamming of the network. Nodes listening for the channel ID (= address), will receive the message. MAM messages contribute to the security of the network by increasing total hashing power and benefit from the data integrity properties of the network. The Bosch XDK IoT developer kit and the RuuviTag, an open source sensor beacon from Ruuvi Labs, already use IOTA's MAM. Example uses for XDK and RuuviTags are portable weather stations, Eddystone proximity beacons, vehicle locators and similar applications which securely report telemetry or receive commands. Another use case are the announced EV charging station from the Dutch energy giant Elaad[2].
IOTA allows instantaneous, high throughput payment channels that are bi-directional and off-Tangle. This allows parties to transact at high speed without waiting for normal confirmation times. When a channel is created, each party deposits an equal amount of IOTA into a multi-signature address controlled by all parties. Once initial deposits are confirmed, the channel does not need to interact with the network until the channel is closed. When the parties finish transacting, final balances are published to the network. This approach can reduce thousands of transactions down to two. 
A sample use is paying for wirelessly charging a phone at a cafe. If the phone and cafe open an IOTA Flash Channel, payments are made by the second from the phone to the cafe. Once the charge is terminated, the channel is closed and one payment is recorded on the Tangle as being conducted between your phone and the cafe.
As of December 2017, neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum have been able to launch their Flash Channels.
The official wallet is version 2.5.4, downloadable from GitHub: https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet/releases. The current wallet requires independently generating your own seed (private key). Instructions how to do that are located here: https://matthewwinstonjohnson.gitbooks.io/iota-guide-and-faq/getting-started/dl-wallet/what-is-my-seed.html. IOTA-help.com is to be avoided as it is a scam site used to steal seeds and IOTA.
IOTA trades for fiat currencies, bitcoin and ether, on the following online exchanges:
Tangle – is a new data structure based on the Direct Acyclic Graph and which does not need miners and data blocks[3].
Each network member who wants to execute a transaction must actively participate in the network consensus by approving two past transactions. This attestation of the validity of the two past transactions ensures that the entire network will reach a consensus on the current status of the approved transactions and will allow using a number of unique functions that only IOTA has: high transaction capacity due to concurrent checking without limits on their number, no commissions for transactions, greater decentralization in comparison with the blockchain and higher security.
Thus, the new IOTA can not be mined: the entire volume of coins was released immediately at the time of their creation. Therefore, it should be borne in mind that if you are doing some work in IOTA, you do not create new tokens, but simply confirm other transactions.
In the future, IOTA will allow companies to introduce new b2b models, turning every technological resource into a potential service that will be sold on the open market in real time without any charges. Secure and authenticated communication channels between devices will be built through the Tangle.
In the future, any physical resources connected to the network can be rented in real time: not only equipment, but also computer capacities and data storage volumes. Also, Tangle opens up new opportunities for secure data transfer to eGovernance, including for electronic voting. Several companies are already conducting research in this direction.
Despite the prospects, the project has critics. In September, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) discovered weaknesses in the IOTA protection system. Although the developers did not agree with the comments, the value of the cryptocurrency fell by 15% after a long period of growth[4].
As of December 2017, the IOTA token costs over $4, market capitalization is around $11.5 billion.



.I TRON 1010841212018-032018-042018-04TRON Recently Launched Public Blockchain Testing Network – testnetTRON Founder Justin Sun Graduates Hupan University, Forges AheadCopyright© 2017-2018 TRON Foundation
TRON is a blockchain-based, descentralized protocol project that aims to be a content distribution platform for the digital entertainment industry [1]. As of April 2018, the public chain test network is online; the main network is not yet live. The countdown for the main network is available here.
Tron Foundation was established in September 2017 by current CEO Justin Sun. The TRON landingpage describes the aim of the protocol as the construction of a global and free entertainment content ecosystem, in which creators have the power to freely publish, store, and own their content, interacting directly with consumers thanks to the decentralized issuance, circulation, and trading of digital assets [2].
Tron ICO was in September 2017 that managed to raise $70 million. The platform's native token is the Tronix (TRX). The coin has been trading since September 2017 and reached its highest market TRX price at $0.30 on January 5th 2018. Its maximum market cap was $19.7 billion on January 5th 2018.[3] It has fluctuated between 1.5 billion and 3.5 billion between February and April 2018. Updated numbers available at CoinMarketCap.com
Tron faced criticism for plagiarism in early 2018, because their whitepaper features open source code from Filecoin and IFPS whitepapers with no citation.[4][5] [6] [1] Justin Sun has since responded that this was just a mistake made by volunteer translators.[7]
Tron code is available at GitHub.
Tron is designed to ultimately make entertainment content both easier to sell and cheaper to consume. In theory this goal is achieved by putting the content on a blockchain and the creators and consumers in a network of peers, eliminating the middleman. [8]
TRON network has built a set of consensus mechanisms, which can use minimum cost to solve identification and personal credit issues in online transactions. It also uses point-to-point transactions to avoid traditional centralized settlement structure. TRON network can play the host role between users and developers, to ensure authenticity and compliance of info credit. [9]
As explained in their website, the Tron Protocol offers "scalable, high-availability and high-throughput support that underlies all the decentralized applications in the TRON ecosystem". The network incentivizes users to build their own decentralized entertainment applications (Dapps).[10].
The Tron network's native token is the Tronix (TRX). One can purchase Tronix on exchanges like Liqui and Binance by exchanging them for other cryptocurrencies like ETH or BTC. Purchase with fiat currencies is not possible at present. It can be stored on wallets that support the Ethereum blockchain like MyEtherWallet[11]. Actually, there is no official Tron wallets.
Tronix can be used by content consumers to pay for the content they want to access on the Tron network. These coins would then go to the content producers’ accounts, where they can be exchanged to other cryptocurrencies, or used to pay for blockchain services.
In February 2018, TRX was ranked 15th on the list of largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. (See also, Tron Surges: Ethereum Tops $1,000 As Bitcoin Price Falls.)
TRON TRX reached its highest market price at $0.30 on January 5th 2018. Tron's market cap peaked at $19.7 billion on the same date. It has fluctuated between 1.5 billion and 3.5 billion between February and April 2018. Updated numbers available at CoinMarketCap.com
The Tron road map is divided into six stages, each with its own name.
The digital entertainment market is estimated at about 1 trillion U.S. dollars, of which most part is occupied with online games like casino. The TRON platform can be compared in terms of volumes with such a company as Ali Baba, which is a world leader in the field of Internet Commerce. Since most of the TRON investors are from China, there is no doubt that this platform will get a lot of popularity there. According to our forecasts in 2018, the cryptocurrency TRX will be able to reach a price of 10 cents per coin, so take a look at it.
The whitepaper for TRON appeared in English, Spanish and Russian translations in early January 2018. The document stated as foundational beliefs that the internet is not the free, descentralized territory it used to be, and that users should have a right to own and control their own data and to disclose information freely and voluntarily [14].
The whitepaper was widely accused of plagiarizing Filecoin and IFPS whitepapers. [4][5] [6] Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, pointed out the whitepaper's plagiarism on Twitter on April 6th 2018.
Justin Sun attributed the lack of citation to translation issues, saying "Our original version of the whitepaper is in Chinese and we have a very detailed reference to the latest Chinese version. The English, Korea, Japanese and Spanish versions are translated by the volunteers. The translation missed numerous important details not just reference"[7] The latests Tron coin news are available on the special resources.



.I NEO 



Copyright © NEO Team 2014-2018   NEO ContributorsNEO (formerly known as Antshares) is a smart economy platform and the first Chinese blockchain project.
The project was founded in 2014 and was real time open source on GitHub in June 2015. It aims to develop a "smart economy" with a distributed network by utilizing blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, and automating the management of digital assets using smart contracts. NEO is currently traded on Bittrex, Cryptopia and Binance among other exchanges.
It is also worth noting that the project is actively developing and has already established cooperation with well-known blockchain startups, including Bancor, Coindash and Agrello. Chinese blockchain startup Red Pulse has announced the creation of a platform for financial research, which will be built on the system of smart contracts NEO 2.0. Also, in cooperation with the NEO project, an operating system on the blockchain called Elastos is being developed. According to the developers, it is intended to “study the technological value of the use of blockchain applications in new Internet operating systems and further development of Smart Economy”.
Having gone through the path of rebranding and numerous software improvements, previously almost unknown cryptocurrency Antshares received a new name – "NEO" and very quickly climbed into the top ten ranking in terms of capitalization.
So, the blockchain system cryptocurrency NEO was launched in the fall of 2016 Chinese programmer Yes, Junpei.
Like the vast majority of digital coins, cryptocurrency NEO has such qualities as:
• Lack of control by the state.
All these features are already familiar to all and are applicable to the vast majority of coins in the digital money market. Therefore, in the top ten ranking on the size of the capitalization of the cryptocurrency NEO climbed thanks to its competitive advantages, which include:
NEO blockchain combines digital assets, digital identities, and smart contracts.The technology underlying NEO supports multiple types of digital assets. Users can register, transfer, and trade at will on NEO.
NEO nodes use Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (dBFT) to reach consensus and ensure the finality of transactions. It also ensures that the system keeps its finality and availability as long as Byzantine fault occurs on less than 1/3 of the nodes. With the use of dBFT protocol, NEO's practical transaction speed is 1,000 TPS and theoretically can reach 10,000 TPS in the future[1].
NeoContract, the NEO smart contract system, supports multiple programming languages such as C#, Java, and Python. Developers can rapidly develop smart contracts based on the NEO platform without learning a new language.
NEON is currently the most used NEO wallet and is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux.
More information in the project whitepaper: http://docs.neo.org/en-us/index.html
The platform includes 2 different tokens – NEO and GAS. NEO represents the right to manage the network, including voting for consensus nodes and making decisions for the blockchain. GAS is used to pay for all the service fees on the blockchain, e.g. creation and launching of smart contracts[2].
In the genesis block of the NEO network, 100 million NEO tokens were created. 50 million of them are on the account and over time, they will be used for the development of the Neo ecosystem. Other 50 million are distributed among the ICO participants according to the pre-developed mechanism. The total amount of NEO tokens is 100 million and cannot be increased. The smallest NEO unit is 1 NEO and cannot be divided. Every NEO represents an ownership of the chain.
GAS is initially generated with the speed of 8 tokens for each new block in the blockchain. The production speed decreases for 1 token per every 2 million generated blocks untill it is down to 1 GAS per block. Approximately in 22 years, the volume of GAS will reach 100 million and its generation will stop. These GAS will be distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio and recorded in the corresponding addresses. NEO holders can initiate a claim transaction at any time and claim these GAS tokens at their holding addresses. Unlike NEO, GAS can be divided. The minimum unit of GAS is 0.00000001.
Early 2018 several projects started performing ICO's on the NEO blockchain, such as Red Pulse, Qlink, Zeepin, TheKey, Trinity and Deep Brain Chain. Upcoming ICO's include NEX and Effect AI.
Despite the prohibition of Chinese authorities to carry out the ICO, the owners of Neo are sure that they will be able to establish fruitful relations with the government of China. In particular, Chinese authorities held consultations with the founder of NEO, Da Hongfei, before making their prohibitive decision[3].
As of March 2018, the NEO cryptocurrency costs $130 and belongs to the tenth of the biggest crypto currencies by the market capitalization, with the value over $8 billion. One GAS token costs $39 at the same moment, while its capitalization makes out a little under $400 million.

Transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your Monero safe. Monero uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. Monero provides all the benefits of a decentralized cryptocurrency, without any of the typical privacy concessions. Sending and receiving addresses as well as transacted amounts are obfuscated by default. Transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity. Monero is fungible because it is private by default. Units of Monero cannot be blacklisted by vendors or exchanges due to their association in previous transactions.Monero for WindowsMonero for MacMonero for LinuxLatest BlockchainNeed it for a different operating system?

Monero (XMR) is an open-source cryptocurrency created in April 2014 that focuses on privacy, decentralization, and scalability that runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD.. Monero uses a public ledger to record transactions while new units are created through a process called mining. Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made as well as making the mining process more egalitarian.
The focus on privacy has attracted illicit use by people interested in evading law enforcement. The egalitarian mining process made it viable to distribute the mining effort opening new funding avenues for both legitimate online publishers and malicious hackers who covertly embed the mining code into websites and apps.
Monero-one of the types of cryptocurrency, which at the same time represents a payment system. Designed for anonymous payments between users. The main issue (the total number of coins for mining) is 18 million 400 thousand coins. Experts estimate that it will take mining Monero about 8 years. The final outcome will be known in may 2022. Initially, it should be understood that the issue of coins will not be finally completed. Each miner can get about 0.6 XMR (monero symbol) for each block.
For the first time to learn about the serious prospects of Monero turned out in 2016. Far from this, the cost of 1 unit of Monero was less than$ 1, but in 2016 the value exceeded$50.
The main value of the coin started to rise at the moment when users started to use Monero as a separate payment on the Darknet. The special perspective of Monero is also in relation to the ruble. Over the past year, the rate has not been growing very fast, but steadily. This is the first indicator that you can and should work with this cryptocurrency.
Unlike many cryptocurrencies that are derivatives of Bitcoin, Monero is based on the CryptoNote protocol and possesses significant algorithmic differences relating to blockchain obfuscation. By providing a high level of privacy, Monero is fungible, meaning that every unit of the currency can be substituted by another unit. These units are indistinguishable from one another. This makes Monero different from public-ledger cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where addresses previously associated with undesired activity can be blacklisted and refused by network members. Also the "stealth addresses" generated for each transaction make it impossible to discover actual destination by anyone else but the address owner. Finally, the "ring confidential transactions" mechanism hides the transferred amount. It can be mined somewhat efficiently on consumer grade hardware such as x86, x86-64, ARM or even consumer grade GPUs.
Monero experienced rapid growth in market capitalization and transaction volume during the year 2016, partly due to adoption in 2016 by major darknet market AlphaBay,
On January 10, 2017, the privacy of Monero transactions were further strengthened by the adoption of Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell's algorithm Confidential Transactions, hiding the amounts being transacted, in combination with an improved version of Ring Signatures.
Monero's blockchain protects privacy in three ways. Ring signatures enable the sender to hide among other transaction outputs, stealth addresses hide the receiving address of the transaction and RingCT hides the amount of the transaction. As a consequence, Monero features an opaque blockchain. This is sharp contrast with transparent and traceable blockchain used by Bitcoin. Thus, Monero is said to be "private, optionally transparent".
Monero has two sets of keys, called a "view key" and a "spend key". View key can be separately shared to enable optional transparency. However, the system is designed to ease processing on mobile devices, as it is impossible to calculate an accurate wallet balance without a spend key.
In April 2017 research highlighted three major threats to Monero user's privacy. The first relies on leveraging the ring signature size of zero, and ability to see the output amounts. The second, described as "Leveraging Output Merging", involves tracking transactions where two outputs belong to the same user, such as when a user is sending the funds to himself ("churning"). Finally the third threat, "Temporal Analysis", shows that predicting the right output in a ring signature is easier than previously thought.
Monero development team addressed the first concern in early 2017 with introduction of Ring Confidential Transactions (ringCT) as well as mandating a minimum size of ring signatures in the March 2016 protocol upgrade. Monero developers also noted that Monero Research Labs, their academic and research arm, already noted and outlined the deficiency in two public research papers in 2014 and 2015.
A user needs a client software, a so-called wallet, to interact with the Monero network. The Monero Project produces the reference implementation of a Monero wallet. This implementation is broken up into three parts. The main software daemon is called monerod and it is responsible for reading the blockchain and claiming the user's transactions. monero-wallet-cli is responsible for managing the user's account, also known as wallet address, and generating new transactions. Finally, Monero GUI allows the user to interact with the aforementioned components through a graphical user interface. All of the software produced by The Monero Project is open source and licensed under a broadly permissive BSD licenses[1].
Other third party implementation of Monero clients exist such as Monerujo which also make it possible to use Monero on Android. Finally, a web wallet allows users to interact with the network entirely through the browser using a third party website.
The feasibility of CPU mining Monero has made it viable for malicious actors to covertly distribute miners embedded in malware, utilising the victim's hardware and electricity for the financial gain of the malware developer.
The JavaScript implementation of Monero miner Coinhive has made it possible to embed the miner into a website in such a way to utilise website visitor's CPU to mine the cryptocurrency while the visitor is consuming the content of the webpage. While this can be done with user's consent in an effort to provide an alternative funding model to serving ads, some websites have done this without informed consent which has prompted the in-browser miners to be blocked by browser extensions and ad blocking subscription lists.
Monero is sometimes employed by Bitcoin users to break link between transactions, with bitcoins first converted to Monero, then after some delay, converted back and sent to an address unrelated to those used before Researchers have reported that the operators behind the global ransomware incident WannaCry have converted their proceeds into Monero. It is also the preferred payment method of choice for The Shadow Brokers[2].
Mining of Monero is based on the principle of PoW (Proof-of-work): the miners receive a reward for solving cryptographic problems, as a result of which a new block is added to the blockchain every two minutes.
In this case, unlike many other crypto currencies, Monero emission is not limited. After it reaches 18.4 million Monero, the subsequent mining will bring 0.6 new coins for each block added to the chain.
The main difference between Monero and other crypto-currencies is the use of CryptoNote protocol for encrypting of transactions. This protocol works on the principle of ring signature, in which any member of any closed group can leave the electronic signature – but the person who did it will never be known. Also, the protocol provides passive mixing of the transactions themselves so that they are all anonymous.
However, anonymity requires large resources, primarily memory: Monero transactions take up on average 8 times as much space as Bitcoin's transactions take.
Mining Monero (XMR/USD) is as easy as mining Zcash and Ethereum (ETH/USD), and you can do it with your CPU, using even your old laptops. In this guide we will take a closer look at the installation process for the Minergate and Claymore miners (its version for the CPU, called CryptoNote). For AMD cardholders, Ethereum mining is the most profitable, however Monero stands out for a number of unique characteristics - above all, the level of confidentiality. It has many fans and periodically there are strong price increases. The entire process of downloading, installing and configuring the mining software takes less than 20 minutes. Here are a few reasons to mine Monero: Bitcoins are easy to exchange for fiat money.
Thus, mining Monero allows you to replenish your bank account. Monero can also be traded on exchanges. Experienced and lucky traders can make good money on price jumps, given Monero’s high volatility. Since Monero received recognition in darknet in 2016, it remains one of the most expensive altcoins in the market. Mining Monero, based on the CryptoNote algorithm, is associated with less power consumption than Ethash / Dagger Hashimoto (Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, UBQ) and Equihash-basedcoins (Zcash, Zencash, Hush). This allows you to lower the temperature of the equipment and extend its service life. At last, the creation of a large Monero position using mining allows us to gain from the growth in the price of cryptocurrency in the future - with less risk than with a normal purchase. The mining and storage of cryptocurrency is similar to the concept of "Buy cheap - sell expensive." The only problem is that most buyers do not understand the technical analysis and do it at the most inopportune time.
Cryptocurrency mining turns your computer equipment into an asset that generates profit. In addition, its value in the secondary market is kept at a high level and even grows. The graphics cards purchased for mining in 2015 and 2016 were often sold at a higher price than the purchase price because of the high demand in the market in 2017. In other words, you can earn good money by mining cryptocurrency on your equipment and selling it when the target is reached. In this case, the sale on the secondary market allows you to compensate for the original value, and the coins produced are a pleasant bonus[3].
The Monero project has a strong team of seven developers. Five of them work under pseudonyms, and two, Riccardo of Spain and Francisco cabanas, are known to the General public. Monero is regularly updated: currently the updates are planned every six months, there will be new features and security enhancements. Thanks to this work plan Monero continues to develop, because everyone knows when you are expected a gradual upgrade of the system.
Immediately after the appearance of Monero, it was criticized for its anonymity, as weapons, drugs and other prohibited goods could be paid by crypto-currency. In part, the criticism turned out to be fair: in 2016, the rapid growth of Monero's market capitalization was due to its use for transactions on the large AlphaBay dark net market, closed by law enforcement agencies in the summer of 2017.
As of mid-October 2017, the Monero exchange rate is $ 95.14. The market capitalization in the amount of $ 1.447 billion approximates the crypto currency closely to the top ten in terms of this indication.

Download the wallet and start using Digital Cash!Dash (formerly known as Darkcoin and XCoin) is an open-source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that aims to be the most user-friendly and most on-chain-scalable cryptocurrency in the world. On top of Bitcoin's feature set, it currently offers instant transactions (InstantSend), private transactions (PrivateSend) and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses to perform work that adds value to the network. Dash's decentralized governance and budgeting system makes it a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).

Dash was originally released as XCoin (XCO) on January 18, 2014. On February 28, the name was changed to "Darkcoin." On March 25, 2015, Darkcoin was rebranded as "Dash." Dash is a portmanteau of "Digital Cash." Creator and lead developer of Dash, Evan Duffield, attributed this to a bug created when the Litecoin code was forked to create Dash, "which incorrectly converted the difficulty, then tried using a corrupt value to calculate the subsidy" Once the problem was resolved, Evan offered to relaunch the coin, but the community overwhelmingly disapproved. He suggested an "airdrop" of coins in order to broaden the initial distribution but the community also disapproved of this proposal. As such, the initial distribution was left alone and development of the project continued. The majority of mined coins were distributed on cryptocurrency exchanges in the following months at very low price levels.
The Dash Core Team, responsible for developing the currency, has since grown to 30 full-time employees, 20 part-time employees, and dozens of unpaid volunteers. All Core Team employees are paid from Dash's budget system and therefore are not reliant on donations or sponsorships that can lead to conflicts of interest.
According to CoinMarketCap, in June 2017 the daily trade volume of Dash was approximately $100 million per day and the market capitalization of Dash exceeded $4.8 billion. Dash has become the most active altcoin community on BitcoinTalk reaching more than 6400 pages, 133k replies, 7.9M reads.
Dash is designed as a dark coin to ensure user privacy and anonymity. Dash uses a Proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.[1].
Unlike Bitcoin's single-tier network, where all jobs on the network are performed by miners, Dash utilizes a two-tier network. Certain network functions, such as creating new blocks, are handled by the miners. The second tier of the Dash network consists of "masternodes" which perform PrivateSend, InstantSend, and governance functions.
Masternodes require 1000 DASH as collateral to prevent sybil attacks. That collateral can be spent at any time, but doing so removes the associated masternode from the network. Because masternodes provide vital network functions, the block reward is split between miners and masternodes, with each group earning 45% of the block reward. The remaining 10% of each block reward funds the "budget" or "treasury" system.
PrivateSend is a coin-mixing service based on CoinJoin, with numerous modifications. These include using masternodes instead of a single website, chaining by mixing with multiple masternodes, restricting the mixing to only accept certain denominations (e.g.: 0.01 DASH, 0.1 DASH, 1 DASH, and 10 DASH, etc.), and passive mode. The maximum allowed for a PrivateSend transaction is 1000 DASH.
Later iterations used a more advanced method of pre-mixing denominations built into the user's cryptocurrency wallet. The implementation of PrivateSend also allows masternodes to submit the transactions using special network code called DSTX, this provides additional privacy to users due to the deadchange issue present in other CoinJoin based implementations such as DarkWallet and CoinShuffle.
In June 2016, DarkSend was rebranded to PrivateSend.
In its current implementation it adds privacy to transactions by combining identical inputs from multiple users into a single transaction with several outputs. Due to the identical inputs, transactions usually cannot be directly traced, obfuscating the flow of funds. PrivateSend makes Dash "fungible" by mixing the coins in the same denomination with other wallets, ensuring that all coins are of the same value.
InstantSend is a service that allows for near-instant transactions. Through this system, inputs can be locked to specific transactions and verified by consensus of the masternode network. Conflicting transactions and blocks are rejected. If a consensus cannot be reached, validation of the transaction occurs through standard block confirmation. InstantSend solves the double-spending problem without the longer confirmation times of other cryptocurriencies such as Bitcoin.
In June 2016, InstantX was rebranded to InstantSend.
Dash is the first decentralized autonomous organization powered by a Sybil proof decentralized governance and funding system. Decentralized Governance by Blockchain (DGBB), often referred to simply as the "treasury system" is a means of coming to consensus on proposed network changes and funding development of the Dash ecosystem. Ten percent of the block rewards go to this "treasury" in order to pay for projects that benefit Dash. Funding from the treasury system has been used to hire additional developers and other employees, to fund attendance at conferences, and to fund integrations with major exchanges and API providers.
Each masternode operator receives one vote. Proposals are eligible for funding according to the following formula: (YES VOTES - NO VOTES) > (TOTAL NUMBER OF MASTERNODES * 0.1). If there are more proposals that meet that criterion than there are budget funds for the month, then the proposals with the highest number of net votes will be paid. Community interaction with proposal submitters is done through the dash.org forums, or through community-driven websites, like DashCentral. These websites allow proposal submitters to provide multiple drafts, then lobby for community support before finally submitting their project to the network for a vote. After the submitter has enough support, the network will automatically pay out the required funds in the next super block, which happens monthly.
The funding system has seen revenue growth. In September 2015, the treasury system provided $14,000 in funding per month. Due to increases in the value of Dash, as of May 2017 the treasury system provides over $650,000 per month in funding. The treasury system has created a positive feedback loop, whereby additional development increases the value of Dash, which increases the amount of funding provided by the budget system.

.I NEM Built for performanceINTRODUCTION TO NEMNEM AdvantagesSmart Asset SystemUse Case ExamplesPlatform ArchitectureStart working with NEMHow does NEM push blockchain performance further?NEM’s blockchain platform was designed and coded from the ground up for scale and speed. NEM’s permissioned private blockchain delivers industry-leading transaction rates for internal ledgers. And its revolutionary consensus mechanism and the Supernode program ensure that NEM’s open, public blockchain can grow without ever compromising throughput or stability.NEM’s blockchain exposes its functionality through a powerful API interface that can be used with any programming language, not a specific “smart contract” language. Existing business logic code can easily mate up and use blockchain where it’s strongest: secure transactions and ledger keeping. In short, configure NEM for your business, and then deploy blockchain incrementally and without forced retooling of existing infrastructure.Unlike other blockchain technologies, NEM is built from the ground up with powerful modular customization for virtually any application. We call it our Smart Asset system. With it, NEM lets you focus on building exactly what you need, whether that’s a fintech system, tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, decentralized authentication, or much more.NEM’s architecture provides an incredibly secure and stable platform through its use of Eigentrust++ and an incentivized public node network based on its two-tier architecture. The significant risks inherent in on-blockchain “smart contracts” are eliminated by providing building block customization to NEM functionality that keeps application security in your hands, not on the blockchain. And NEM’s private blockchain option allows complete control over internal data privacy when a public blockchain isn’t the right solution.Focus on building exactly what you need, whether that’s a fintech system, tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, decentralized authentication, or much more.The NEM Smart Asset System allows you to totally customize how you use the NEM blockchain. First, your Namespace defines your home on the blockchain where you can name your own Mosaics, provide easy-to-remember names to user addresses, and more.Mosaics then are the basic building blocks of Smart Assets that you can use to represent lots of simple things: it could be a coin, a signature, a status update or more – you decide.To create truly Smart Assets however, NEM allows you to create Addresses that act as containers for Mosaics that can be connected with Multisig rules. An address can simply represent a user, such as an account holder. But it can also represent an individual unique asset such as a document, or a song, or a package. You can then update that asset through configurable Transactions.See our “example use cases” below to see how Smart Assets can be used to create a wide variety of blockchain solutions, quickly and reliably.NEM’s modular Smart Asset system enables businesses to build an incredible variety of real world application uses. By using NEM’s built-in features to define your Smart Assets and connect them together, you can represent almost any system of business transactions on the blockchain with minimal development.To see how to use NEM Smart Assets to build these and more use cases in more detail, see our Enterprise Use Cases page.NEM’s architecture is designed for both simplicity and flexibility of development. The blockchain itself is supported by nodes running NEM-provided software that implements NEM’s feature set and unique consensus mechanism. This may either be the open, decentralized, self-supporting NEM public blockchain, or it may be a permissioned private NEM blockchain running on your own servers.The NEM blockchain's range of features is made available to you through simple RESTful JSON calls to an API Gateway Server. This drastically simplifies creation of client apps, or interfacing servers to the blockchain. You can implement your usage of the blockchain using any language you prefer without being forced to reimplement existing business logic or develop in an unfamiliar environment.Fields marked with * are requiredI would like to receive regular news updates from NEMFields marked with * are required Contact Contact Contact© NEM.io Foundation Ltd (Singapore) 2014 - 2018 | All Rights Reserved | NEM ™
NEM is a peer-to-peer blockchain platform for app developers. Its native cryptocurrency is the XEM.[1] Its code was created from scratch in Java by the New Economy Movement (NEM), which seeks to build "a new economy based on the principles of financial freedom, decentralization, equality and solidarity".[2] [3] The project was conceived in January 2014 by the pseudonymous BitcoinTalk.org user UtopianFuture. The NEM blockchain, launched in March 2015, is public. NEM Foundation also runs a newer, private blockchain – Mijn. 
NEM aims to offer businesses a scalable[4], easily customizable platform with built-in services and features[5] such as "Namespaces (unique domains), Mosaics (customizable assets), 2.0 multisig contracts, and three forms of messaging".[6] The platform is not intended to be private or anonymous; transactions are completely traceable.[7]
NEM was written in Java, and a C++ version is in progress. The NEM blockchain uses an original consensus mechanism called Proof of Importance.[8] XEM cannot be mined. The total finite sum of 8,999,999,999 XEM was distributed to stakeholders upon project launch. XEM are either bought, or earned as a reward for 'harvesting', i.e. processing transactions.[7] Unlike other blockchains and institutions, the NEM blockchain does not instrinsically support smart contract.
The NEM.io Foundation (led by president Lon Wong, and VP Jeff McDonald) is based in Singapore.[9] NEM is most popular in Japan.

The project was created in January 2014, spearheaded by the pseudonymous UtopianFuture on BitcoinTalk.org forum. UtopianFuture was inspired by NXT, but wished to improve it.[10] Controversy surrounded the pseudonymous figure when "revelations that (UtopianFuture) was controlling multiple BitcoinTalk accounts to attack other AltCoins" led to his dissaperance.[2][11] The original declaration of principles and objectives of the project is in the OP, here.
Part of what motivated the creation of NEM was a perception that Bitcoin had gone mainstream.[2] Though there were originally thoughts of forking from the NXT blockchain, creators decided to build a new code from scratch in Java.
In order to carry out a fair initial distribution of XEM, the original token – NEMstake – was distributed to users who either contributed to the project in BTC via the Bitcointalk forums, in NXT via the NXT Asset Exchange, or contributed to the initial development and promotion of the project[12] (with code, marketing, graphics, etc).[2] A Sustainability Fund was "created to avoid a sizeable portion of the community distribution being under direct control of the development team as a result of unclaimed stakes. To mitigate this, a number of sub-funds would be declared with each sub-fund being allocated a percentage of the Sustainability Fund."[12]
A detailed account of NEM's original call to participation and stake redepmtion process is avaiable here.
The NEM Foundation was established on March 15 2017, incorporated in Singapore.[11] Its president is Lon Wong, its VP Jeff McDonald.
Approximately $545 million worth of NEM were stolen from the Tokyo-based Coincheck exchange on January 26th 2018. According to the Japan Times, the NEM Foundation "tracked stolen coins by marking accounts used for illicit transfers and urged virtual currency exchanges around the world not to process NEM payments from (them)." On March 12, the exchange announced reimbursements for the victims, some 260,000 holders.[9]
The NEM movement was created to build a "new economy based on the principles of financial freedom, decentralization, equality and solidarity". [2]
The NEM platform is meant to offer blockchain solutions to entrepeneurs and businesses.[13][14] It is meant to be easy to use, without a need for programming. It is designed for speed and scaleability, not for secrecy, which is why it has been described as being a contender to Visa, Paypal and Mastercard rather than a project for anonymity.[7]
The foundation is committed to working with businesses, governments and educational institutions. Its self declared purpose is to "introduce, educate, and promote the use of the NEM blockchain technology platform on an international scale to all industries and institutions." With the NEM distributed ledger, the Foundation helps businesses to effectively store transaction, customer, and supplier data; offers governments ways to improve transparency, prevent fraud, and establish trust; and allows educational institutions to store data around assessments, degrees, and transcripts, as well as verification of knowledge transfer between parties.[15]
The supply structure of NEM is finite with no emission.[16] This means that the entire finite supply of 8,999,999,999 XEM was distributed to 1500 original stake holders[14] who later distributed it within the community, at the birth of the project. Thus, XEM cannot be mined, and no inflation should be possible. NEM can be obtained in transactions with other holders, or by harvesting.[16][7]
Harvesting in NEM is analogous to mining in blocklchains like Bitcoin. It serves the same purpose of processing transactions and creating blocks in exchange for a reward in native cryptocurrency. The significant difference between mining and harvesting is that the latter does not need any specialized, high-energy-consuming hardware.[16][7]
When users broadcast transactions to the network, they pay a low transaction fee that goes towards supernodes. Supernodes are nodes that process payments on the network in order to obtain a reward in XEM (i.e. supernodes are nodes that harvest).
Users must have at least 10,000 XEM in their wallet in order to harvest, and 3 million XEM in order to become a supernode.  david_hay
"For users to be eligible to harvest XEM coins, a harvester’s wallet must have at least 10,000 vested XEM coins and, with the total supply of XEM being 8,999,99,999, that means that there can be a maximum total of 899,999 accounts that have an importance score of greater than zero. In the world of NEM, a harvester is essentially a miner, receiving transaction fees upon the formation of a new block created by a harvester. An additional characteristic that exists in the NEM world, is the existence of delegated harvesting. Harvesters are able to delegate the harvesting so that a harvester continues to earn transaction fees".[17]
Proof of Importance (PoI) is a consensus mechanism introduced by NEM as an alternative to the proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. It is meant to reflect how much support a user affords the network; i.e. how important a user is. Because NEM has no miners, voting power in the network is decided according to importance, measured by how many coins a user has, how many transactions have been made to and from the user's NEM wallets, and by nodes' reputation as reported by the Eigentrust++ algorithm (read section below).[17][3] PoI is similar to PoS in that is takes into account the amount of coins a user owns. However, PoI fundamentally differs from PoS in that it also takes into account transactions and overall behavior; it rewards users who spend the coins and disincentivizes users who hoard them. This ensures that the circulation of XEM in the network stays active.
The tenant behind PoI is that users who own and spend large amounts of XEM will make decisions that benefit the development of the project for good, since raising the value of the XEM is in their own interest.[7]
Eigentrust++ is a security clustering algorithm which monitors past behavior of nodes in the network and enables nodes to give reputation to their neighbors in clusters.[3] It is crucial to the PoI system.
The NEM platform has in-built multi-signature (multi-sig) contracts. They are different from Bitcoin's multi-sig, which are not intrinsic to the blockchain but reliant on third party software.[18]
Multi-sig contracts assign the rights and powers of one account to other accounts, turning regular accounts into multi-signature accounts. This allows groups of users to administrate the activity of an account, control assets and mosaics, or create additional contracts. A multi-sig account cannot send funds on its own but is bound by the contract and administered accordingly to the contract designated 'cosigners'.[18]
In an example, A and B could be two users who each have a Nano Wallet. They could sign either a multi-signature contract that gives each of them independent access to the funds in a multi-signature account (this is called a "multi-user account"), or a multi-signature contract in which any transaction needs to be approved by both of them (this is called a "multisig account").[18]
On the NEM bockchain, Apostille is used to notarize documents and make public timestamps.[2]
Nem is built around the “Smart Asset System”, which allows for a customized use of the blockchain, "as if it were a custom blockchain built for (the user's) application and assets".[19]
NEM is especially popular in the Japanese market, said to be second only to Bitcoin.[7][16] The director of NEM Japan is Zaif CEO, Takao Asayama.
Mijn is a private blockchain for businesses that require more secrecy.[20] It is based off of NEM technology.[21]
Catapult is an upgrade on the Mijn blockchain. Catapult enables 4,000 transactions to be processed per second.[20] NEM's Catapult is the first blockchain solution to apply the private/public chain model.[22]
The official NEM wallet is the Nano Wallet. It is available for download here

Tether uses blockchain via the Omni Layer protocol. The Omni Layer protocol is the software with an open source code that interacts with blockchain, ensuring the release and redemption of crypto currency token on the basis of Bitcoin.
Tether currencies are 100% supported by the actual currency actives on a reserve account of the Tether platform. The crypto currency can be bought or exchanged for fiat currencies in accordance with the service terms of Tether Limited.
Tether USD crypto currency is presented on a range of exchanges including Poloniex, Bitfinex, Kraken, and presents a virtual analog of the US dollar. In September 2017, the Ethfinex exchange announced about the support of USDT.
In summer 2017, the plans about issuing USDT tokens on the blockchain of Litecoin were announced.
At the moment, Tether is working with US dollars and euros; in the nearest future it is planned to add operations with Japanese yens. Tethers pegged to these currencies are marked as USDT, EURT and JPYT correspondingly. The financial support of the crypto currencies is carried out by a bank trust that is working in Taiwan.
The ratio of the volume of Tether issued coins and the financial support can be seen on the platform’s website in the real-time mode.
Despite the stated parity of USDT and USD, in the middle of October 2017, the crypto currency is traded for a little under one dollar.
Theoretically, USDT can be exchanged for dollars at any moment at the Tether platform itself. However, in the platform’s rules it is stated that Tether is not money and not financial tools and Tether Limited is not obliged to carry out the exchange of its tokens for fiat currencies as well as it doesn’t guarantee such exchange and protection from losses when buying, selling or buying out of Tethers.
Some experts think that in this way the company insures from possible regulatory restrictions in various jurisdictions. However, in the same way, the crypto currency may actually lose a real support because it won’t be managed to actualize the right of its exchange.
Tether holds itself as a crypto platform that is obliged to act in a safe and transparent way, following all requirements and rules at that.
This is why Tether doesn’t work in those countries and some states of the USA that do not regulate virtual currencies.
Among the countries with a limited functioning of crypto currencies are: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Korea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Syria, Uganda, Vanuatu, and Yemen. The use of crypto currencies is also limited in New York and Washington.

.I Ethereum Classic Ethereum Classic is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.Ethereum Classic is a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain - the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions.We believe the core value proposition of any blockchain is immutability; valid transactions can never be erased or forgotten. Individuals interacting on Ethereum Classic are governed by this reality; Code is Law.This does not necessarily mean that code replaces existing laws, or that only code is law (there are many geographical jurisdictions), but it gives users the opportunity to enter into a new blockchain-based jurisdiction where agreements are governed by code.By entering into contracts on Ethereum Classic, you can be certain that the network remains neutral. The outcome of transactions will be dictated by code you voluntarily interact with. Unless explicitly defined by the contract code, there are no reversals, no undos, no opt-outs.Transactions are final; applications are unstoppable.There are many problems that fester due to centralization and opaqueness; corruption, unaccountability, nepotism, inefficiency and stagnation. Ultimately, centralization leads to fragility; only decentralized systems can stand the test of time.These problems can be only solved by adhering to governance systems that do not rely on a central point of failure. Just like distributed networks and the consensus protocol itself, we believe that only truly decentralized projects can survive in the long run.Ethereum Classic manifests these values by relinquishing control by a formalized central foundation. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation. No backroom deals or behind-closed-doors unilateral decision making; just free and open discourse.Vitalik Buterin and The Ethereum Foundation create the first blockchain-based turing-complete smart contract platformSlock.it construct TheDAO Ethereum Contract; a security audit is completed by DejavuTheDAO smart contract is deployed; members of the public send it value in return for DAO tokensSlock.it announce a $1.5 Million USD proposal, paid in Ether by the crowdfund, 'to guarantee the integrity of The DAO'On the last day of the crowdsale, DAO curator Vlad Zamfir calls for a moratorium on TheDAO, citing many game-theoretical security issuesThe crowdsale completes to become the world's largest and raising an incredible $150 Million USDPeter Vessenes publicly discloses the existence of a critical security vulnerability overlooked in many Solidiy contractsStephan Tual publicly claims that TheDAO funds are safe despite the newly-discovered critical security flawEther is slowly and silently drained from TheDAO as the re-entry bug is appliedThe price of Ether is slashed in half as Griff Green announces that TheDAO has been hackedTheDAO's splitting mechanism gives around a month for a solution to be found that recovers the funds; Foundation and community developers race to implement a soft forkA group of 'white-hat' hackers secure 70% of TheDAO funds but protocol-level action is required to save the remaining 30% split by the hackerThe Ethereum Foundation releases a 'Soft Fork' client to censor transactions coming from the hacker; mining pools vote to enable it by lowering gas limitCritical Denial of Service flaws are found in the Soft Fork implementation, miners quickly decide not to use itMany days of intense arguing goes on in the Ethereum community about the pros and cons of implementing a Hard ForkThe only remaining option is a controversial Hard Fork.

It provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. Ethereum Classic also provides a value token called "classic ether", which can be transferred between participants, stored in a cryptocurrency wallet and is used to compensate participant nodes for computations performed.
The classic ether token is traded on cryptocurrency exchanges under the ticker symbol ETC. Gas, an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to prevent spam on the network and allocate resources proportionally to the incentive offered by the request.[1]
The Ethereum platform has been forked into two versions: "Ethereum Classic" (ETC) and "Ethereum" (ETH). Prior to the fork, the token had been called Ethereum.  After the fork, the new tokens kept the name Ethereum (ETH), and the old tokens were renamed Ethereum Classic" (ETC). Ethereum Classic appeared as a result of disagreement with the Ethereum Foundation regarding The DAO Hard Fork. It united members of the Ethereum community who rejected the hard fork on philosophical grounds. Users that owned ETH before the DAO hard fork (block 1920000[2]) owns an equal amount of ETC after the fork.
Ethereum Classic passed a technical hard fork to adjust the internal prices for various opcodes of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on October 25, 2016, similar to the hard fork committed by Ethereum a week previously. The purpose of the hard fork was a more rational distribution of payments for resource-intensive calculations, which led to the elimination of the favorable conditions for attacks that were previously conducted on ETH and ETC. A hard fork held in the beginning of 2017 successfully delayed the "bomb complexity" that was added to the Ethereum code in September 2015 with a view of exponentially increasing the complexity of mining and the process of calculation of new network units. In late 2017, a hard fork occurred which changed the monetary policy with unlimited emissions to a system similar to Bitcoin.

In May 2016, a venture capital fund called The DAO built on Ethereum raised around $168 million, with the intention of investing in projects using smart contracts. In the same month a paper was released detailing security vulnerabilities with The DAO that could allow ether to be stolen. In June, 3.6 million Ether (approximately $50 million USD) was taken from accounts in The DAO and moved to another account without the owners' consent, exploiting one of the vulnerabilities that had been raised in May.  Members of The DAO and the Ethereum community debated what actions, if any, should occur to resolve the situation. A vote occurred and in July 2016 it was decided to implement a hard fork in the Ethereum code and to move the Ether taken in the exploit to a new smart contract through which it would be restored to the owners from whom it had been taken.[3]
Ethereum Classic came into existence when some members of the Ethereum community rejected the hard fork on the grounds of "immutability", the principle that the blockchain cannot be changed, and decided to keep using the unforked version of Ethereum.[4]
Ethereum Classic underwent a technical hard fork to adjust the internal pricing for running various op codes on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on 25 October 2016, similar to the hard fork the ETH chain did a week earlier. The goal was to more rationally price various compute-intensive and external reference commands to reduce the incentive for spammers who had conducted a month-long distributed denial-of-service attack on the Ethereum Classic network. A hard fork that occurred early 2017 successfully delayed the so-called "difficulty bomb", originally added to Ethereum's code in September 2015 in order to exponentially increase the difficulty of mining, or the competitive process by which new transaction blocks are added to the network.[5] The people who continued with Ethereum Classic advocate for blockchain immutability, and the concept that "code is law" against the pro-fork side (Ethereum) which largely argued for extra-protocol intentionality, decentralized decision-making, and conflict resolution.
Various critics of Ethereum Classic have denounced it as a scam[6] and a potential theft of intellectual property, with similar controversial remarks being made on behalf of the opposing camp. Ethereum Classic has retained some users of Ethereum and has also attracted others from the wider crypto-community who reject contentious forks on ideological grounds. The project, however, is not officially supported by the Ethereum Foundation.[7]
On June 29th, 2017 the Ethereum Classic Twitter account made a public statement indicating reason to believe that the Classic Ether Wallet Website had been compromised. Information security news organization Threatpost later reported that the compromise occurred due to a social engineering attack against the CEW websites domain registrar 1@1. The Ethereum Classic Twitter account confirmed the details released via Threatpost. The Ethereum Classic team worked with CloudFlare, a company specializing in internet security services, to place a warning on the compromised domain warning users of the phishing attack.
Ethereum Classic works via blockchain with smart contracts. Smart contracts are contracts with prescribed conditions that are fulfilled automatically when these conditions are achieved.
The participants of the blockchain network can give “classic ether” to each other, keep it in their wallets. With “ether, the node participants are also rewarded for carrying out calculations while checking transactions. The inner mechanism of the pricing formation of transactions, gas, is used for the prevention of spam in the network and distribution of resources proportionally to the incentive offered by the request.
The division of the initial Ethereum platform into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic happened after a big hacker attack on The DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) – the platform for venture investments on the base of Ethereum. In June 2016, the hackers managed to find a loophole in the defense and transfer about 50 million dollars from DAO – a third part of the collected amount.
As according to the terms of the smart contract, the funds could be used only 28 days after the transaction, there came a possibility to get back the stolen funds before the attackers could take them. During the search for a solution, the blockchain community has been divided.
Some people believed that the system should be “rolled back” to the moment of the attack on DAO and a new fork of blockchain should be created to return the stolen funds to all victims with the help of the smart contract.  A part of the community made a stand against this decision stating that it defies the very principles of the blockchain as a self-regulated and democratic system.
However, the majority has voted for the division and so the present Ethereum platform has appeared. The part that was left on the old blockchain has created Ethereum Classic.
On the base of Ethereum the cryptocurrency “ether” (ETH) is working, which the “classic ether” (ETC) of the Ethereum Classic platform has nothing in common with. Ethereum is constantly developing and releasing updates, but Ethereum Classic cannot use them. In addition, Ethereum supports more big players of the cryptocurrency market.
In the middle of October 2017, one “classic ether” is traded for $11.55 with the market capitalization of 1.112 billion dollars. At the same time, one ETH costs $293.37, and the capitalization of Ethereum is over 27.9 billion dollars.

Join us to be a contributor of a worldwide network system that predicts the future.The latest Bytecoin news, updates and useful tipsBytecoin Price Online From CoinMarketCap
Bytecoin (BCN) is the first CryptoNote based cryptocurrency launched in July 2012. CryptoNote [1] technology provides absolute anonymity to Bytecoin using Ring Signatures [2] and one-time addresses. This type of anonymous transactions make it almost impossible to find out the sender/receiver address. Currently Bytecoin developers are the most active ones so the CryptoNote cause still prospers.
Bytecoin (BCN) is often confused with a Bitcoin fork also named Bytecoin (BTE), launched April 1st, 2013. The latter is a near-exact copy of Bitcoin. Bytecoin (BCN) was created from scratch and is not a fork of Bitcoin in any way. Bytecoin’s history is completely covered in mist: countless puzzles, unknown developers names and secret messages. 
where MSupply = (2^64 - 1) atomic units and 'A' is amount of already generated coins;
Bytecoin is a CPU-mined currency which makes it more attractive to more people. Bytecoin is using Egalitarian Proof-of-Work egalitarian ASIC/GPU resistant CryptoNight algorithm. Basically, every modern PC should be able to handle profitable Bytecoin mining.
Bytecoins genesis block was found [3] all the way back in July 2012.
There always been a lot of mystery behind the Bytecoin. Reddit user joethejudge77[4] created a theory of why Bytecoin was meant to start in 2012.[5] How the technology logically came to the advent of cryptocurrencies with ring signature and memory-bound function PoW implementation. Soon after Bitcoin's release the community started to raise concerns about its anonymity with multiple solutions and propositions. 
Another interesting part of Bytecoin’s history is its deep web heritage. There is not much information about that period of time. Though there is a few interesting links which are pointing to some parts of Bytecoin history in DW. 
One other thing worth mentioning is so called “teams” that were working, testing and mining Bytecoin back in a day. Old BCN website newsfeed contains a lot of references to these teams, such as: V. Hugo, The R guy, Dante etc. This part of the history was also confirmed in the Bytecoin thread on Bitcointalk.[6]
Bytecoin is an open source software. Crypto currency uses the principle of Proof-of-work ("Proof of work performance").
The algorithm for mining in Bytecoin differs in that it actively uses the AES command system for x86 microprocessors and a large amount of memory, which makes mining on the GPU less efficient than for Bitcoin.
It uses the unique CryptoNight algorithm. The essence of the algorithm is in the ring signature, which provides the maximum program anonymity for today. The cryptographic basis for the protocol was created by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Yael Taumann in 2001, and finalized by E. Fujisaki and K. Suzuki in 2007. The EdDSA scheme proposed by the American mathematician Daniel Bernstein is used as the signature algorithm. Additional transaction obfuscation was added to this basis.
Due to CryptoNote and the obfuscation added to the protocol, passive mixing is provided: all transactions in the system are anonymous, and all participants in the system can use plausible deniability in the event of a capture.

Bytecoin advertises itself as a completely anonymous altcoin. Bytecoin claims the following features[7]:
Bytecoin is primarily used for anonymous transactions. In addition, Bytecoin is used as a currency in some online stores.

As of 1 December 2017, the Dukley Hotel & Resort in Montenegro allows booking rooms by paying with Bytecoin. Since January of 2018, the Domaine de Cromey in Saint-Sernin-du-Plain, France allows booking of food and wine related holidays by paying in Bytecoin. Also in January, online wine retailer Burgundy Wine Cellars who delivers small production Burgundy wine to most of the United States began accepting payment in Bytecoin and other Cryptocurrencies.

.I Qtum 
Qtum (read Quantum) is a Chinese hybrid platform that connects the existing blockchain with a virtual machine, such as Ethereum. A platform that enables developers to build applications and smart contracts on the current blockchain technology.
Focusing on building a platform that helps companies create smart contracts on blockchain, Qtum is a toolkit in the first place. Designed to be both robust and modular, the platform can create small contracts to be used on most major blockchain.
Qtum is a project for the creation of a public blockchain with an open-source code, combining the technologies of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Qtum Foundation Company that is implementing the project is located in Singapore and was founded by Patrick Dai, the developer of the Chinese origin[1].
Qtum ICO start date: 2017-03-17
Qtum (Quantum) is an open-source, decentralized project that aims to capitalize on the success of Bitcoin, while competing for the Decentralized Application (DAPP) and Smart Contract market. The goal is to work with industry partners, and launch the first Value Transfer Protocol (VTP). This will streamline daily business routines, and allow for easier adoption. Qtum aims to become the platform with Smart Contracts that execute as part of an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO).
More information in the project whitepaper: https://qtum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Qtum_blockchain_economy_whitepaper_20170209_EN.pdf
While bitcoin is pleased to remain a standard cryptocurrency, providing users with very little functionality, safely protecting against each other cryptocurrencies, Qtum creates a platform capable of running decentralized applications and smart contracts.
When a business develops a new application, website, or software, the application database must be stored on the server. This is called a centralized system. It doesn't matter if this database is stored on the same server or on multiple servers, a hacker attack can change the datasets, and there is no way to verify what was changed. The platform enables enterprises to develop decentralized applications. Using blockchain technology for bitcoin to store transactions in each user's system, all transactions must be verified, and after verification there is no way to change them without alerting each user of the chain.
Smart contracts are considered contracts of the future. They are similar to how a Bank's standing order (SO) will work. Just as SO-Bank takes EUR300 on the FIRST day of each month, a smart contract transfers digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies from one user to one or more other users, based on a set of predefined requirements.Smart contracts exist on a blockchain and run automatically if the requirements encoded in the contract are met. The platform offers a scripting language that allows users to easily create such contracts.
Based on Bitcoin's UTXO model, the simple payment verification (SPV) Protocol is supported by default by The qtum codebase. As a result, you can now execute smart contracts from lite-wallets, which can be easily installed on any mobile device, declaring the age of mobile decentralized applications. Thanks to this, the blockchain is finally ready to present itself in a world in which half of all Internet traffic is generated by smartphones and tablets.
The platform extends the bitcoin scripting language to work as a means to port code to the EVM Qtum version. This makes it possible to execute smart contracts and run decentralized applications simply and securely in environments that were previously inaccessible to creating entire chains, combining the endless possibilities offered by smart contracts with the stability and maturity of the bitcoin ecosystem[2].
Qtum is compatible with existing Ethereum contracts as well as Bitcoin gateways and will maintain backward compatibility even if the system is upgraded.
The Qtum technology combines the transaction model of Bitcoin with the developed consensus system of Ethereum[3].
On the one hand, the Qtum blockchain uses the UTXO model (unspent transaction outputs, or a set of unused transaction outputs). This model blocks the outputs and requires from the users to provide evidence of the asset ownership to spend it - this is how Bitcoin works. Along with this, a virtual machine for smart contracts on the analogy with Ethereum is built in over the Qtum blockchain. Thus, the Qtum blockchain combines the proof-of-work consensus and the smart contract technology.
Thanks to a hybrid nature of the blockchain in combination with the first of a kind PoS consensus protocol, Qtum apps will be able to be compatible with the main blockchains as well as support the work on mobile devices and the devices of the “Internet of things”. 
QTUM market cap on 12 OCT 2017: $686,878,000     
QTUM price on 12 OCT 2017: $11.64
The developers of Qtum believe that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own disadvantages that hold off the developers of corporate products from these technologies and hope to take this niche.
The project has awakened interest already on the development stage and managed to attract $1 million from Blockchain angels (venture investors in the sphere of blockchain) at once. The coming to the ICO also turned out to be successful and brought $15.6 million to the startup[4]. 
The emission of Qtum at the moment of the ICO in April 2017 made out 100 million tokens. 51% of them were available for selling to a wide audience on exchanges; the remaining 49% were distributed according to a predetermined mechanism.
By the middle of October 2017, Qtum tokens are traded for $11.69 with the market capitalization of almost $690 million.

.I Zcash Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies expose your entire payment history to the public. Zcash is the first open, permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.Get StartedLearn More
A decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that provides strong privacy protections							
Shielded transactions hide the sender, recipient, and value on the blockchain							
If Bitcoin is like http for money, Zcash is https—a secure transport layer							In order to remain equally interchangeable, units of cryptocurrency must be unlinked from their history so that one unit is as good as any other unit. Zcash brings fungibility to cryptocurrency by unlinking shielded coins from their history on the blockchain.Zcash is pioneering the use of zero-knowledge proofs, applying cutting-edge cryptography to blockchain technology. Zero-knowledge proofs allow fully encrypted transactions to be confirmed as valid. This new property will enable entire new classes of blockchain applications to be built.In the pre-digital currency world, both individuals and enterprises could justifiably assume that their financial transactions would be kept confidential. With Zcash, users can enjoy the advantages of using a public blockchain, while still being sure that their private information is protected.

Zcash finally fulfills an early promise of Bitcoin technology - the ability to transact freely and privately with anyone in the world. This protects the right to privacy held by all individuals on Earth, and opens up new commercial use cases which were impossible without truly confidential transactions.Zcash is an important project being worked on by a very talented team.Zcash has garnered a lot of attention from all around the world. VCs have invested in Zcash, there’s cutting edge security technology behind it and that’s resulted in quite a lot chatter in the crypto community. Zcash holds an extraordinary amount of promise.Technically, it's a challenge to have fungibility in a shared blockchain, yet money requires fungibility. It's exciting to see the Zcash team working toward adding real fungibility to blockchains and with the strength and talent of this team, this is only the tip of the iceberg.Privacy is an essential part of cryptocurrency security, and despite some initial mistaken beliefs to the contrary, Bitcoin alone doesn't provide that. Zcash is the first cryptocurrency that provides the level of privacy users deserve and expect.Zcash is strongest where Bitcoin is weakest; It gives users the easy ability to maintain their financial privacy. If anything can compete with Bitcoin, it will be on this front.

                    © 2017 Zerocoin Electric Coin CompanyZcash (ZEC) is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency that ensures privacy and selective transparency of transactions.  Zcash payments are published on the public blockchain, but the sender, receiver and transfer amount remain confidential.
The level of anonymity of Zcash is noted by many well-known companies and individuals. For example, WikiLeaks began accepting donations in Cash, Edward Snowden called cryptocurrency the most interesting alternative to Bitcoin, and Europol officially expressed concern about the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency.

Zcash cryptocurrency is based on the protocol of Bitcoin, however, it supports its own blockchain and currency token. Like Bitcoin, Zcash cryptocurrency can be sent around the world and exchanged for other crypto or fiat currencies through online exchanges, personal transfers etc.
The emission capacity of Zcash makes out 21 million coins, new blocks with the size of 2 Mb are being created every 2.5 minutes. The block reward makes out 12.5 ZEC and will be reduced twice every 4 years starting from the moment of launch in October 2016.
The main technical peculiarity of Zcash is the use of the zero-knowledge proof, which allows to confirm transactions without disclosing additional information and makes the use of the crypto currency totally anonymous.
In 2014, zerocoin developers from Johns Hopkins University and cryptographic teams from Massachusetts Institute of technology, Israel Institute of Technology and tel Aviv University developed the zerocash Protocol. Together they were able to improve the original design, making it more efficient and more private[1].
The zcash for the project was officially announced as the Executive Director Zuko Wilcox. January 20, 2016 as the evolution of the Existing zerocoin project (work of Matthew green, Ian Mayer, Christina Harman, Aviel D. Rubin, Johns Hopkins University, Department of computer science).
With the use of the new Protocol appeared independent cryptocurrency Zcash (ZEC), ceased to be a "Supplement" to bitcoin. On October 28, 2016, Zuko Wilcox held the official" cryptographic ceremony " of the Zcash launch.
Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic principle that allows to check transactions with encrypted data of the sender’s address, receiver’s address and the transferred amount.
Zcash uses a specific type of the zero-knowledge proof that is called zk-SNARKs. For that end, in a Zcash transaction a data string (“key tuple”) is generated by the sender, which consists of a spending key, viewing key and billing address.
A sender cannot generate this string unless he possesses spending keys or the values of sending and receiving are not equal. Zk-SNARKs also creates a unique nullifying function, which marks the tokens as spent after the transaction completion.
Usually, a collection of a billing address, viewing and spending keys is encrypted and unavailable for users. In this way, the transaction check with the keeping the confidentiality of its details is carried out. However, Zcash can carry out public transaction too, providing
all data of keys in this case[2].
During the first 4 years, a tenth of the whole possible money stock will be divided among the founders, investors, employees and consultants of the Zcash project – the so-called “rewarding of founders”.
The investors who invested funds in the creation of Zcash will all together receive 1.65%, the founders, employees and consultants – 5.72%. Another 1.19% will go to the “Strategic Reserve of Zcash Company”, while the remaining 1.44% will be received by the non-commercial organization Zcash Foundation, founded in May 2017. The strategic reserve will be used for financing of a new project that will increase the value of Zcash Company and the task of the Foundation is to support and maintain the Zcash protocol.
As of the middle of October, Zcash costs about $227.07 with the market capitalization of $536.83 million, being according to the latter parameter on the 15th place among all crypto currencies active in the market.
Due to a complicated mechanism of Zcash transactions, they take much time into account – up to 1-2 minutes, while traditional crypto currencies spend several seconds on it. In September 2017, the developers announced that they have created a new algorithm that makes the generation process of zk-SNARK five times faster. The software update must be released in 2018.
At the beginning of October, the Waves Platform added new gateways or Zcash and Litecoin. The management of Zcash announced that they plan to develop the crypto currency in the Asian market, having announced the entry into Bithumb, the South-Korean exchange[3].

      Blockchain is a public ledger of information collected through a network that sits on top of the internet. It is how this information is recorded that gives blockchain its groundbreaking potential.    
      A cryptocurrency is a digital form of money built on blockchain technology that only exists online. Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to verify and secure transactions, hence their name.    
      One of the most exciting aspects of blockchain technology is that it's entirely decentralized. We examine how this system works, what it means for our future and why it is so revolutionary.    
      A consensus protocol is what keeps all the nodes on a network synchronized, while providing an answer to the question: how can we all make sure that we agree on what the truth is?    
      A node can be any active electronic device as long as it is connected to the internet. The role of a node is to support the network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and, in some cases, to process transactions.    
      An Initial Coin Offering is a form of fundraising for blockchain projects, wherein cryptocurrencies are offered to investors before they are listed on exchanges. In this segment we will share successful examples, examine how ICOs work and how to safely participate.     
      An ICO is not a fundraising tool for any business. Running an ICO is a delicate and complex process and should be treated as such. Here we will detail what is required and best practises to follow, as well as some tips based on experience.    
      JavaScript is undeniably the language of the internet. Lisk is written in JavaScript for accessibility as its the most commonly used programming language in the world.    
      Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is the protocol of choice at Lisk and with very good reason. DPoS uses real-time voting combined with a social system of reputation to achieve consensus.    
      Lisk uses cryptographic hashing in order to secure all aspects of the system. The system uses EdDSA as it provides a much faster mechanism for hashing and providing security.    
      Lisk provides several incentives for securing the network. As an active delegate, you can earn block generation rewards and accrue transaction fees for the round in which you participate.    
      In order to run Lisk Core, there are some prerequisites to satisfy each distribution type. First choose your desired distribution method and then head over to Lisk's technical documentation to get hands on guidance for Binary, Docker and Source installations.    
      Lisk as a software has three major components, the JavaScript code, NodeJS as a compute engine and PostgreSQL as a storage and database solution. Interested in learning more about each component?    
      Each API entry contains an example call to help provide understanding of how to use the call. These examples rely on curl being installed and Lisk running on the localhost on port 8000 (Mainnet).    A shared drive to provide exceptional tools unites our founders Max and Oliver. As a bold visionary and a seasoned developer, they truly understand their community’s ambitions and obstacles. Together with their team, they inspire developers globally to freely create, collaborate, and change the way connected systems work now and tomorrow. Max and Oliver aim to empower and connect future blockchain creators in a first-of-its-kind community focused blockchain, concentrating on the accessibility of JavaScript, technological and business education, as well as democratic inclusion within the network’s ecosystem.
                Lisk stands firmly behind a development first approach. Our growing team of engineers is committed to delivering high quality code day in and day out.              Thank you for subscribing! Are you interested in a specific topic?Lisk (LSK) is a blockchain application platform, established in early 2016 by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows. Based on its own Blockchain network and token LSK, Lisk will enable developers to create, distribute and manage decentralized Blockchain applications by deploying their own sidechain linked to the Lisk network, including a custom token. Thanks to the flexibility of sidechains, developers can implement and customize their Blockchain applications entirely.
Lisk started as a fork of Crypti beginning with an ICO (Initial coin offering) to decide the initial distribution and raise development funds. The ICO raised 14,000 BTC and, at the time, was the second most successful cryptocurrency crowdfund (later that month, WAVES and The DAO would surpass it). On May 24, 2016, the mainnet for Lisk went live and it became available for trading on major exchanges. Quickly after trading started, Lisk briefly became the second most popular cryptocurrency traded against Bitcoin[1].
Since November 2017, Lisk has suprassed a market cap of $1,000,000,000, thus joining the rank of other blockchain unicorns.
Lisk aims to be the first (successful) of its kind as a modular cryptocurrency. The idea is that every Blockchain App is on its own sidechain, separate from the main blockchain. This should help with scalability issues that many cryptocurrencies were facing. The sidechain is secured by a group of 101 master nodes elected by the app's owner, and operate using the same Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism as the parent Lisk network. The Blockchain Apps are written using NodeJS/JavaScript on the backend and CSS3/HTML5/JavaScript for the frontend.
Lisk uses the DPoS (Delegated-Proof-of-Stake) algorithm originally created by BitShares. What differentiates it from regular PoS (Proof of Stake) is that only the top 101 delegates (determined by voting weight of voters) are actively forging and securing the network.
Lisk DPoS functions through a series of rounds. Rounds consist of 101 individual blocks. Each of the 101 active delegates are randomly assigned 1 block within the round to forge. A full cycle round takes 17 minutes. If a selected delegate is unable to forge their assigned block, activity from that block moves to the next block in the round.
The Lisk network forges blocks in 10s intervals. In the event that a delegate fails to properly forge their assigned block, the transactions move to the next block in the round, causing the block to be extended by 10s. Each subsequent missed block results in a 10s delay for transaction processing and confirmations.
Lisk utilizes an inflationary forging rewards system which creates new LSK for every successful block. During year 1, the forging rewards are set at 5 LSK per block. Every 3,000,000 blocks (~1 year) forging rewards are reduced by 1 LSK, ending at 1 LSK per block after 5 years. The forging rewards will then stay at 1 LSK per block indefinitely. The Forging Rewards will be equally distributed through all active (top 101) delegates, same as any network fees.
Decentralized application or Dapps are exactly what the name suggests. Applications of any sort running on many servers, providing unseen security, uptime and entirely new business models. A powerful component of the Lisk application platform is the ability to deploy, distribute and manage decentralized applications all in one place with a seamless user experience. Decentralized applications include the whole package of front-end (what the user sees) and back-end (the logic behind it). A smart contract on the other hand, consists only of the back-end, and often only a small part of it. This means that if you want to create a decentralized application on a smart contract system (i.e. not with Lisk), you have to combine several smart contracts and rely on 3rd party systems for the front-end. Possible use cases include applications that offer proof-of-ownership, improved online identity verification or asset management. In order to build your own application it requires a developer to code it in JavaScript. By offering an SDK written in JavaScript, Lisk enables millions of developers around the world an accessible way to create their own decentralized applications by deploying their own Blockchain sidechain next to the Lisk network[2].
With a fully functioning mainnet, Lisk is currently developing a variety of tools to enable developers and app comissioners to easily create their own decentralized apps:
Lisk is commonly compared to other blockchain platforms Ethereum and Crypti, so it is important to note their differences[4].
