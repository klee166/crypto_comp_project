.I Bitcoin Bitcoin is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.Bitcoin.org is community supported: 3FkenCiXpSLqD8L79intRNXUgjRoH9sjXa
.I Ethereum You are responsible for your own computer security. If your machine is compromised you will lose your ether, access to any contracts and possibly more.You are responsible for your own actions. If you mess something up or break any laws while using this software, it's your fault, and your fault only.You are responsible for your own karma. Don't be a jerk and respect the rights of others. What goes around comes around.The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Ethereum open source software platform (“Ethereum Platform”). Prior to any use of the Ethereum Platform, the User confirms to understand and expressly agrees to all of the Terms. All capitalized terms in this agreement will be given the same effect and meaning as in the Terms. The group of developers and other personnel that is now, or will be, employed by, or contracted with, Stiftung Ethereum (“Stiftung Ethereum”) is termed the “Ethereum Team.” The Platform will be developed by persons and entities who support Ethereum, including both volunteers and developers who are paid by nonprofit entities interested in supporting the Ethereum Platform.The user acknowledges the following serious risks to any use the Ethereum Platform and ETH and expressly agrees to neither hold Ethereum Stiftung nor the Ethereum Team liable should any of the following risks occur:The Ethereum Platform and ETH could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Stiftung Ethereum to continue to develop the Ethereum Platform, or which could impede or limit the ability of a User to use Ethereum Platform or ETH.It is possible that alternative Ethereum-based networks could be established, which utilize the same open source source code and open source protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform. The Ethereum network may compete with these alternative Ethereum-based networks, which could potentially negatively impact the Ethereum Platform and ETH.It is possible that the Ethereum Platform will not be used by a large number of external businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could impact the development of the Ethereum Platform and potential uses of ETH.  It cannot predict the success of its own development efforts or the efforts of other third parties.The User recognizes that the Ethereum Platform is under development and may undergo significant changes before release. The User acknowledges that any expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Ethereum Platform held by the User may not be met upon release of the Ethereum Platform, for any number of reasons including a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the implementation of the Ethereum Platform.The Ethereum Platform rests on open-source software, and there is a risk that the Ethereum Stiftung or the Ethereum Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Stiftung Ethereum, may introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Ethereum Platform causing the system to lose ETH stored in one or more User accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Ethereum Platform.Cryptography is an art, not a science. And the state of the art can advance over time. Advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Ethereum Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of ETH. To the extent possible, Stiftung Ethereum intends to update the protocol underlying the Ethereum Platform to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but it cannot predict the future of cryptography or guarantee that any security updates will be made in a timely or successful manner.As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Ethereum Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to:Any successful attacks present a risk to the Ethereum Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of ETH transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations. Despite the efforts of the Ethereum Stiftung and Team, known or novel mining attacks may be successful.If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for ETH could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can create new ETH tokens. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Instability in the demand of for ETH may lead to a negative change of the economical parameters of an Ethereum based business which could result in the business being unable to continue to operate economically or to cease operation.If the Ethereum Platform is rapidly adopted, the demand for transaction processing and distributed application computations could rise dramatically and at a pace that exceeds the rate with which ETH miners can bring online additional mining power. Under such a scenario, the entire Ethereum Platform could become destabilized, due to the increased cost of running distributed applications. In turn, this could dampen interest in the Ethereum Platform and ETH. Insufficiency of computational resources and an associated rise in the price of ETH could result in businesses being unable to acquire scarce computational resources to run their distributed applications. This would represent revenue losses to businesses or worst case, cause businesses to cease operations because such operations have become uneconomical due to distortions in the crypto-economy.Acknowledgment, Acceptance of all Risks and Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities
THE USER EXPRESSLY KNOWS AND AGREES THAT THE USER IS USING THE Ethereum PLATFORM AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK. THE USER REPRESENTS THAT THE USER HAS AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS, USAGES AND INTRICACIES OF CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, ETH PLATFORM AND ETH.  THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO RISKS OF, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, ETH OR THE Ethereum PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NEITHER Stiftung Ethereum NOR ETHEREUM TEAM SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER. IN PARTICULAR, NOTHING IN THESE TERMS SHALL AFFECT THE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF ANY USER OR EXCLUDE INJURY ARISING FROM ANY WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR FRAUD OF Stiftung Ethereum.We recommend any groups handling large or important transactions to maintain a voluntary 24 hour waiting period on any ether deposited. In case the integrity of the network is at risk due to issues in the clients, we will endeavor to publish patches in a timely fashion to address the issues. We will endeavour to provide solutions within the voluntary 24 hour waiting period.All disputes or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with the Terms, the breach thereof, or use of the Ethereum Platform shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by one or more arbitrators appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration. The arbitration panel shall consist of one arbitrator only, unless the ICC Court of Arbitration determines that the dispute is such as to warrant three arbitrators. If the Court determines that one arbitrator is sufficient, then such arbitrator shall be Swiss resident. If the Court determines that three arbitrators are necessary, then each party shall have 30 days to nominate an arbitrator of its choice -- in the case of the Claimant, measured from receipt of notification of the ICC Court’s decision to have three arbitrators; in the case of Respondent, measured from receipt of notification of Claimant’s nomination. All nominations must be Swiss resident. If a party fails to nominate an arbitrator, the Court will do so. The Court shall also appoint the chairman. All arbitrators shall be and remain “independent” of the parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be Zug, Switzerland. The language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the tribunal shall apply the laws of Switzerland and any discovery shall be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a formal hearing. The tribunal shall not assume the powers of amiable compositeur or decide the case ex aequo et bono. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver can validly be made.Stiftung Ethereum is finally not liable for:Ethereum is a  decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.These apps run on a custom built  blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.The project was bootstrapped via an ether presale in August 2014 by fans all around the world. It is developed by the  Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit, with contributions from great minds across the globe.On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. If a single app is compromised or goes offline, many users and other apps are affected.On a blockchain, anyone can set up a node that replicates the necessary data for all nodes to reach an agreement and be compensated by users and app developers. This allows user data to remain private and apps to be decentralized like the Internet was supposed to work.The  Ethereum Wallet  is a gateway to decentralized applications on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows you to hold and secure ether and other crypto-assets built on Ethereum, as well as write, deploy and use smart contracts.Create a tradeable digital token that can be used as a currency, a representation of an asset, a virtual share, a proof of membership or anything at all. These tokens use a standard coin API so your contract will be automatically compatible with any wallet, other contract or exchange also using this standard. The total amount of tokens in circulation can be set to a simple fixed amount or fluctuate based on any programmed ruleset.Do you already have ideas that you want to develop on Ethereum? Maybe you need help and some funds to bring them to life, but who would lend money to someone they don’t trust?Using Ethereum, you can create a contract that will hold a contributor's money until any given date or goal is reached. Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or safely returned back to the contributors. All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearinghouse or having to trust anyone.You can even use the token you created earlier to keep track of the distribution of rewards.Now that you have developed your idea and secured funds, what’s next? You have to hire managers, find a trustworthy CFO to handle the accounts, run board meetings and do a bunch of paperwork. Or you can simply leave all that to an Ethereum contract. It will collect proposals from your backers and submit them through a completely transparent voting process.One of the many advantages of having a robot run your organization is that it is immune to any outside influence as it’s guaranteed to execute only what it was programmed to. And because the Ethereum network is decentralized, you'll be able to provide services with a 100% uptime guarantee. Now it's your turn: start building what you dream of creating in Ethereum! Could your business be enhanced by operating on a cryptographically secure, decentralized, tamper-proof network?Check out the many great projects* already being built on Ethereum. And since you'll be among the first developers in the world that are able to program decentralized applications, some of them might need your help.  *The above list is maintained by an independent party and the Foundation does not endorse its content or any particular projectIf you feel more comfortable around a terminal, you can download our command line tools.

                            Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash

No hassles.StableA payment system that's a proven store of value.SecureWorld's most robust blockchain technology.Bitcoin Cash brings sound money to the world, fulfilling the original promise of Bitcoin as "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash". Merchants and users are empowered with low fees and reliable confirmations. The future shines brightly with unrestricted growth, global adoption, permissionless innovation, and decentralized development.All Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 are also owners of Bitcoin Cash. All are welcome to join the Bitcoin Cash community as we move forward in creating sound money accessible to the whole world.The Bitcoin Cash network will undergo a protocol upgrade on May 15th 2018. Businesses and individuals who use the Bitcoin Cash network should check to ensure that their software is compatible with the upgrade. A specification is available, and the upgrade is being tested on testnet. This upgrade is the first of planned series of protocol upgrades announced late 2017 by several developer groups.On Chain Scalability - Bitcoin Cash follows the Nakamoto roadmap of global adoption with on-chain scaling. As a first step, the blocksize limit has been made adjustable, with an increased default of 8MB. Research is underway to allow massive future increases.New Transaction Signatures - A new SigHash type provides replay protection, improved hardware wallet security, and elimination of the quadratic hashing problem.New Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm (DAA) - Responsive Proof-of-Work difficulty adjustment allows miners to migrate from the legacy Bitcoin chain as desired, while providing protection against hashrate fluctuations.Decentralized Development - With multiple independent teams of developers providing software implementations, the future is secure. Bitcoin Cash is resistant to political and social attacks on protocol development. No single group or project can control it. The bitcoin-ml mailing list is a good venue for making proposals for changes that require coordination across development teams. Workgroups have been set up to assist developers to coordinate and seek peer-review. For those wishing to implement changes to the Bitcoin Cash protocol, it is recommended to seek early peer-review and engage collaboratively with other developers through the workgroups.What is Bitcoin Cash?Bitcoin Cash is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.Is Bitcoin Cash different from 'Bitcoin'?Yes. Bitcoin Cash is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer digital cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.If I own Bitcoin, do I automatically own Bitcoin Cash too?Anyone who held Bitcoin at the time Bitcoin Cash was created became owners of Bitcoin Cash. This means that Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 (August 1st, 2017 about 13:16 UTC) have the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as they had Bitcoin at that time. If your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your Bitcoin Cash.Any transactions after the August 1st ledger split are completely separate between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. This means any Bitcoin acquired after the split does not include any Bitcoin Cash, and any Bitcoin Cash does not include any Bitcoin.How is transaction replay being handled between the new and the old blockchain?Bitcoin Cash transactions use a new signature hashing algorithm indicated by the flag SIGHASH_FORKID. These signatures are not valid on the Bitcoin Legacy network. This prevents Bitcoin Cash transactions from being replayed on the Bitcoin blockchain and vice versa.Why was a fork necessary to create Bitcoin Cash?The legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block, or about 3 transactions per second. Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.Was the 1 MB block size limit causing problems for Bitcoin?Yes, in 2017, capacity hit the 'invisible wall'. Fees skyrocketed, and Bitcoin became unreliable, with some users unable to get their transactions confirmed, even after days of waiting.Bitcoin's market price has increased, but its growth and usefulness as a currency has stagnated. Many users, merchants, businesses and even investors left Bitcoin for alternatives, causing its dominance to fall from 95% to as low as 40%.Does Bitcoin Cash fix these problems?Yes. Bitcoin Cash immediately raised the block size limit to 8MB as part of a massive on-chain scaling approach. There is ample capacity for everyone's transactions.Low fees and fast confirmations have returned with Bitcoin Cash. The network is growing again. Users, merchants, businesses, and investors are building the future with real peer to peer cash.Why didn't Bitcoin raise the block size if it was easy?Some of the developers did not understand and agree with the original vision of peer-to-peer electronic cash that Satoshi Nakamoto had created. Instead, they preferred Bitcoin become a settlement layer.Many miners and users trusted these developers, while others recognized that they were leading the community down a different road than expected.These two very different visions for Bitcoin are largely incompatible, which led to the community divide.Didn't SegWit increase the block capacity? Will Bitcoin Cash ever have SegWit?Segregated Witness or "SegWit" is an unacceptable substitute for increasing the blocksize for several reasons.First, even if used in 100% of transactions, the increase would equate to 1.7MB blocks. Thus, it is a small capacity increase at best. It will not handle exponential growth or worldwide usage. Second, the soft fork implementation results in discardable signatures, which weakens Bitcoin's security model. Third, it makes future capacity increases more difficult due to bandwidth inefficiency and quadratic hashing attacks which SegWit doesn't solve since an attacker isn't forced to use it.For those (and other) reasons, Bitcoin Cash was necessary as a pre-SegWit fork. Segwit will not be adopted.Which Development Team is In Charge of Bitcoin Cash?Unlike the previous situation in Bitcoin, there is no one single development team for Bitcoin Cash. There are now multiple independent teams of developers.This decentralization of development (and decentralization of software implementations) is a much needed and important step forward.What is the ticker symbol for Bitcoin Cash?Bitcoin Cash is usually represented by the ticker symbol BCH.

                               Monero is cash for a connected world. It’s fast, private, and secure. With Monero, you are your own bank. You can spend safely, knowing that others cannot see your balances or track your activity.Get StartedMonero is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is secure digital cash operated by a network of users. Transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your Monero safe. Monero uses ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses to obfuscate the origins, amounts, and destinations of all transactions. Monero provides all the benefits of a decentralized cryptocurrency, without any of the typical privacy concessions. Sending and receiving addresses as well as transacted amounts are obfuscated by default. Transactions on the Monero blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity. Monero is fungible because it is private by default. Units of Monero cannot be blacklisted by vendors or exchanges due to their association in previous transactions.Monero for WindowsMonero for MacMonero for LinuxLatest BlockchainNeed it for a different operating system?

.I NEM Built for performanceINTRODUCTION TO NEMNEM AdvantagesSmart Asset SystemUse Case ExamplesPlatform ArchitectureStart working with NEMHow does NEM push blockchain performance further?NEM’s blockchain platform was designed and coded from the ground up for scale and speed. NEM’s permissioned private blockchain delivers industry-leading transaction rates for internal ledgers. And its revolutionary consensus mechanism and the Supernode program ensure that NEM’s open, public blockchain can grow without ever compromising throughput or stability.NEM’s blockchain exposes its functionality through a powerful API interface that can be used with any programming language, not a specific “smart contract” language. Existing business logic code can easily mate up and use blockchain where it’s strongest: secure transactions and ledger keeping. In short, configure NEM for your business, and then deploy blockchain incrementally and without forced retooling of existing infrastructure.Unlike other blockchain technologies, NEM is built from the ground up with powerful modular customization for virtually any application. We call it our Smart Asset system. With it, NEM lets you focus on building exactly what you need, whether that’s a fintech system, tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, decentralized authentication, or much more.NEM’s architecture provides an incredibly secure and stable platform through its use of Eigentrust++ and an incentivized public node network based on its two-tier architecture. The significant risks inherent in on-blockchain “smart contracts” are eliminated by providing building block customization to NEM functionality that keeps application security in your hands, not on the blockchain. And NEM’s private blockchain option allows complete control over internal data privacy when a public blockchain isn’t the right solution.Focus on building exactly what you need, whether that’s a fintech system, tracking logistics, an ICO, document notarization, decentralized authentication, or much more.The NEM Smart Asset System allows you to totally customize how you use the NEM blockchain. First, your Namespace defines your home on the blockchain where you can name your own Mosaics, provide easy-to-remember names to user addresses, and more.Mosaics then are the basic building blocks of Smart Assets that you can use to represent lots of simple things: it could be a coin, a signature, a status update or more – you decide.To create truly Smart Assets however, NEM allows you to create Addresses that act as containers for Mosaics that can be connected with Multisig rules. An address can simply represent a user, such as an account holder. But it can also represent an individual unique asset such as a document, or a song, or a package. You can then update that asset through configurable Transactions.See our “example use cases” below to see how Smart Assets can be used to create a wide variety of blockchain solutions, quickly and reliably.NEM’s modular Smart Asset system enables businesses to build an incredible variety of real world application uses. By using NEM’s built-in features to define your Smart Assets and connect them together, you can represent almost any system of business transactions on the blockchain with minimal development.To see how to use NEM Smart Assets to build these and more use cases in more detail, see our Enterprise Use Cases page.NEM’s architecture is designed for both simplicity and flexibility of development. The blockchain itself is supported by nodes running NEM-provided software that implements NEM’s feature set and unique consensus mechanism. This may either be the open, decentralized, self-supporting NEM public blockchain, or it may be a permissioned private NEM blockchain running on your own servers.The NEM blockchain's range of features is made available to you through simple RESTful JSON calls to an API Gateway Server. This drastically simplifies creation of client apps, or interfacing servers to the blockchain. You can implement your usage of the blockchain using any language you prefer without being forced to reimplement existing business logic or develop in an unfamiliar environment.Fields marked with * are requiredI would like to receive regular news updates from NEMFields marked with * are required Contact Contact Contact© NEM.io Foundation Ltd (Singapore) 2014 - 2018 | All Rights Reserved | NEM ™

.I Ethereum Classic Ethereum Classic is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.Ethereum Classic is a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain - the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions.We believe the core value proposition of any blockchain is immutability; valid transactions can never be erased or forgotten. Individuals interacting on Ethereum Classic are governed by this reality; Code is Law.This does not necessarily mean that code replaces existing laws, or that only code is law (there are many geographical jurisdictions), but it gives users the opportunity to enter into a new blockchain-based jurisdiction where agreements are governed by code.By entering into contracts on Ethereum Classic, you can be certain that the network remains neutral. The outcome of transactions will be dictated by code you voluntarily interact with. Unless explicitly defined by the contract code, there are no reversals, no undos, no opt-outs.Transactions are final; applications are unstoppable.There are many problems that fester due to centralization and opaqueness; corruption, unaccountability, nepotism, inefficiency and stagnation. Ultimately, centralization leads to fragility; only decentralized systems can stand the test of time.These problems can be only solved by adhering to governance systems that do not rely on a central point of failure. Just like distributed networks and the consensus protocol itself, we believe that only truly decentralized projects can survive in the long run.Ethereum Classic manifests these values by relinquishing control by a formalized central foundation. The only hierarchy is that of transparent meritocracy and mutual reputation. No backroom deals or behind-closed-doors unilateral decision making; just free and open discourse.Vitalik Buterin and The Ethereum Foundation create the first blockchain-based turing-complete smart contract platformSlock.it construct TheDAO Ethereum Contract; a security audit is completed by DejavuTheDAO smart contract is deployed; members of the public send it value in return for DAO tokensSlock.it announce a $1.5 Million USD proposal, paid in Ether by the crowdfund, 'to guarantee the integrity of The DAO'On the last day of the crowdsale, DAO curator Vlad Zamfir calls for a moratorium on TheDAO, citing many game-theoretical security issuesThe crowdsale completes to become the world's largest and raising an incredible $150 Million USDPeter Vessenes publicly discloses the existence of a critical security vulnerability overlooked in many Solidiy contractsStephan Tual publicly claims that TheDAO funds are safe despite the newly-discovered critical security flawEther is slowly and silently drained from TheDAO as the re-entry bug is appliedThe price of Ether is slashed in half as Griff Green announces that TheDAO has been hackedTheDAO's splitting mechanism gives around a month for a solution to be found that recovers the funds; Foundation and community developers race to implement a soft forkA group of 'white-hat' hackers secure 70% of TheDAO funds but protocol-level action is required to save the remaining 30% split by the hackerThe Ethereum Foundation releases a 'Soft Fork' client to censor transactions coming from the hacker; mining pools vote to enable it by lowering gas limitCritical Denial of Service flaws are found in the Soft Fork implementation, miners quickly decide not to use itMany days of intense arguing goes on in the Ethereum community about the pros and cons of implementing a Hard ForkThe only remaining option is a controversial Hard Fork. A Specification is determined and announced by Slock.it and Ethereum Foundation membersWith 12 hours notice, The Ethereum Foundation use a controversial third party 'coin vote' to determine that the Hard Fork should be turned on by default; consensus is declared and an updated client is releasedWith around 80% of nodes updating to the new client, the community nervously await the arrival of the Hard Fork activation block 1920000The community lets out a sigh of relief as the Hard Fork code is succesfully implemented with no obvious flaws; champagne corks are popped all over the globeWith predictions of the original non-forked chain to disappear within hours, many are surprised to find that miners continue mining blocks and OTC trading of the original chain tokens gives them valueThe largest Ethereum exchange lists 'ETC' - Ethereum Classic; many exchanges quickly follow suit, ETC price peaks to 1/3 of ETH'sFlame wars begin in the once peaceful /r/Ethereum and /r/ethtrader subreddits and economically-charged vitriolic spats begin to take hold of the community as it comes to terms with the splitThe Ethereum Classic community begins to branch off from the forked-chain subreddits and form its own communication channels, including /r/EthereumClassic, Slack and TelegramThe Robin Hood Group attempts to dump a large quantity of stolen ETC on the market.

.I Zcash Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies expose your entire payment history to the public. Zcash is the first open, permissionless cryptocurrency that can fully protect the privacy of transactions using zero-knowledge cryptography.Get StartedLearn More
A decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency that provides strong privacy protections							
Shielded transactions hide the sender, recipient, and value on the blockchain							
If Bitcoin is like http for money, Zcash is https—a secure transport layer							In order to remain equally interchangeable, units of cryptocurrency must be unlinked from their history so that one unit is as good as any other unit. Zcash brings fungibility to cryptocurrency by unlinking shielded coins from their history on the blockchain.Zcash is pioneering the use of zero-knowledge proofs, applying cutting-edge cryptography to blockchain technology. Zero-knowledge proofs allow fully encrypted transactions to be confirmed as valid. This new property will enable entire new classes of blockchain applications to be built.In the pre-digital currency world, both individuals and enterprises could justifiably assume that their financial transactions would be kept confidential. With Zcash, users can enjoy the advantages of using a public blockchain, while still being sure that their private information is protected.

Zcash finally fulfills an early promise of Bitcoin technology - the ability to transact freely and privately with anyone in the world. This protects the right to privacy held by all individuals on Earth, and opens up new commercial use cases which were impossible without truly confidential transactions.Zcash is an important project being worked on by a very talented team.Zcash has garnered a lot of attention from all around the world. VCs have invested in Zcash, there’s cutting edge security technology behind it and that’s resulted in quite a lot chatter in the crypto community. Zcash holds an extraordinary amount of promise.Technically, it's a challenge to have fungibility in a shared blockchain, yet money requires fungibility. It's exciting to see the Zcash team working toward adding real fungibility to blockchains and with the strength and talent of this team, this is only the tip of the iceberg.Privacy is an essential part of cryptocurrency security, and despite some initial mistaken beliefs to the contrary, Bitcoin alone doesn't provide that. Zcash is the first cryptocurrency that provides the level of privacy users deserve and expect.Zcash is strongest where Bitcoin is weakest; It gives users the easy ability to maintain their financial privacy. If anything can compete with Bitcoin, it will be on this front.

      Blockchain is a public ledger of information collected through a network that sits on top of the internet. It is how this information is recorded that gives blockchain its groundbreaking potential.    
      A cryptocurrency is a digital form of money built on blockchain technology that only exists online. Cryptocurrencies use cryptography to verify and secure transactions, hence their name.    
      One of the most exciting aspects of blockchain technology is that it's entirely decentralized. We examine how this system works, what it means for our future and why it is so revolutionary.    
      A consensus protocol is what keeps all the nodes on a network synchronized, while providing an answer to the question: how can we all make sure that we agree on what the truth is?    
      A node can be any active electronic device as long as it is connected to the internet. The role of a node is to support the network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and, in some cases, to process transactions.    
      An Initial Coin Offering is a form of fundraising for blockchain projects, wherein cryptocurrencies are offered to investors before they are listed on exchanges. In this segment we will share successful examples, examine how ICOs work and how to safely participate.     
      An ICO is not a fundraising tool for any business. Running an ICO is a delicate and complex process and should be treated as such. Here we will detail what is required and best practises to follow, as well as some tips based on experience.    
      JavaScript is undeniably the language of the internet. Lisk is written in JavaScript for accessibility as its the most commonly used programming language in the world.    
      Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is the protocol of choice at Lisk and with very good reason. DPoS uses real-time voting combined with a social system of reputation to achieve consensus.    
      Lisk uses cryptographic hashing in order to secure all aspects of the system. The system uses EdDSA as it provides a much faster mechanism for hashing and providing security.    
      Lisk provides several incentives for securing the network. As an active delegate, you can earn block generation rewards and accrue transaction fees for the round in which you participate.    
      In order to run Lisk Core, there are some prerequisites to satisfy each distribution type. First choose your desired distribution method and then head over to Lisk's technical documentation to get hands on guidance for Binary, Docker and Source installations.    
      Lisk as a software has three major components, the JavaScript code, NodeJS as a compute engine and PostgreSQL as a storage and database solution. Interested in learning more about each component?    
      Each API entry contains an example call to help provide understanding of how to use the call. These examples rely on curl being installed and Lisk running on the localhost on port 8000 (Mainnet).    A shared drive to provide exceptional tools unites our founders Max and Oliver. As a bold visionary and a seasoned developer, they truly understand their community’s ambitions and obstacles. Together with their team, they inspire developers globally to freely create, collaborate, and change the way connected systems work now and tomorrow. Max and Oliver aim to empower and connect future blockchain creators in a first-of-its-kind community focused blockchain, concentrating on the accessibility of JavaScript, technological and business education, as well as democratic inclusion within the network’s ecosystem.
                Lisk stands firmly behind a development first approach. Our growing team of engineers is committed to delivering high quality code day in and day out.              Thank you for subscribing! Are you interested in a specific topic?

Scalable smart contracts interfacing with real world data.
Read Whitepaper
Hello IoT, IoV, FinTech, Video Gaming, The Unbanked, Trustless Exchanges, and instant Micropayments!We believe in relentless evolution of systems and societies. æternity will push the boundaries of innovation and make blockchain technology ready for mass adoption.
              A network of state channels enables the exchange of value with anybody in the world in a trustless way. Participants interact privately with each other. Businesses have their records off-chain and not in public. Participants have infinite almost instant transactions. Participants can handle use cases that require very high volumes of transactions.
            
                  State channels make it possible to execute smart contracts off-chain. Only in case of a disagreement between the contracting parties does the smart contract code get enforced by the blockchain.
                Why is that a breakthrough? 
              Consensus is achieved via a novel Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. The "Cuckoo Cycle" PoW is more power-efficient and indirectly useful, as it encourages the development of better random access memory (DRAM) chips. Even smartphones can mine, achieving unparalleled decentralization.  Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is used for governance, which is done via (delegated) voting, weighted by the amount of tokens the account holds.
            
                  Consensus is achieved via a novel hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) algorithm.
                How does this work? 
              æternity provides tools enabling participants to govern themselves effectively. It is essential to note that governance is very much a human problem that most likely cannot be "solved" purely by technical means. æternity's governance is implemented via delegated voting, weighted by the amount of tokens the account hold and provides both technical tools to permit governance and frameworks for human interaction for effective discussion.
            
                  æternity is governed by its stakeholders, meaning that miners, token-holders and others with a stake in the blockchain have the ability to make decisions together on proposed changes.
                How does this work? 
              What if the fulfillment of a smart contract depends on weather conditions, a share price, or other public information from the real world? Oracles can provide tamper-proof data which contracts can act upon. Election results, the prices of assets such as gold, weather conditions and many other real-world values play a crucial role for many business applications.
            
                  An oracle connects real world data with smart contracts. æternity has oracles on the blockchain, as truly first-class objects.
                How can an oracle be helpful? 
                    For many business applications it's crucial to have transactions which are not recorded in public. Smart contracts executed in state channels touch the blockchain only in the case of disagreement, acting like a self-arbitrating crypto court.
                  
                    State-of-the-art cryptographic datastructures and unparalleled decentralization provide efficiency and eliminate single-point-of-failure.
                  
                    By leveraging state channels as the default way to run smart contracts, æternity becomes the most efficient Turing-complete blockchain and thus enables new forms of commerce via it's low cost transactions.

.I Decred Decred is a multi-platform digital currency with support for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Easy-to-use wallet apps enable sending, receiving, and mining Decred with just a few clicks.For those who like to tinker, Decred provides a full suite of command line tools allowing customization of the Decred experience.There are three main ways to interact with Decred:The Wallet - For sending and receiving funds as well as participating in PoS mining.Proof-of-work Mining - Using computing power to validate transactions on the network and generate new Decred tokens.Proof-of-stake Mining - Using funds to vote on important network development matters and validate transactions for rewards.The Web Wallet is the easiest way to get started with Decred. All users can access it online via wallet.decred.org, without the need to download anything.For Windows, macOS, and Linux users, Decrediton wallet is available.For help getting started you can visit our Beginner’s Guide.An address is the only thing needed to send or receive funds. It can be easily generated from any Decred wallet. Decred addresses always begin with D and contain 26-36 alphanumeric characters.After a transaction is made, funds will usually clear in about 5 minutes. There is a small fee to help with the upkeep of the network. This fee is in addition to the transaction amount. That is, a transfer of 100DCR would incur a fee of about 0.006DCR.The block explorers mainnet.decred.org and explorer.dcrdata.org allow users to search all the blocks and transactions in the Decred blockchain.The term mining represents the process of validating transactions on the Decred network and keeping it secure. In return for work, miners are rewarded with newly generated Decred coins.Decred has two methods of validating transactions: Proof-of-work (PoW) and Proof-of-stake (PoS).In Proof-of-work (PoW) transactions are grouped into blocks. These blocks are validated by PoW miners. When a block is validated it becomes a permanent part of the Decred network.You can become a miner by dedicating spare computing resources to the network. In return miners are rewarded with Decred.For efficiency and convenience you can join mining pools. The pools are groups of miners who share the work and split the reward. Joining a mining pool is an excellent way for smaller contributors to receive consistent payouts for their work.Unlike PoW, Proof-of-stake mining (PoS) requires little computing resources. Decred funds are used to purchase voting tickets on the network. In every block, five tickets from the pool of live tickets are chosen at random to vote on the validity of the previous block. PoS adds an extra layer of decentralization to Decred and allows users to vote on suggested network changes. Pools are also available for PoS to ensure your tickets are ready to vote whenever they're called.Decred is still new, and at this time, the easiest way to purchase it is with Bitcoin. Once you have some Bitcoin, it can be traded for Decred at digital currency exchanges.Through decentralized processes, people with different ideas, goals, and opinions can help shape the future. You will likely have some questions, so come join our growing community, where you can connect with developers and other users, get information, ask questions, or just hang out.

The optional One Time Addresses (OTA) provides complete anonymity for the receiver of every transaction. Private Send function breaks down every transaction input to a standard denomination, thereby providing further obfuscation to the transaction amountBased on complex algebra, locked accounts with SMPC enables low threshold to convert any digital asset from any blockchain into a corresponding proxy asset on Wanchain's blockchain. This unleashes the power to build compelling distributed cross-chain Dapps and removes centralized counterparty risk. Wanchain will support ERC20 and protocol tokensWanchain's blockchain builds upon the strengths and robustness of Ethereum.

.I RChain    Scalable Blockchain ApPlicationS    Scalable Blockchain ApPlicationS "To become a blockchain solution with industrial-scale utility, RChain must provide content delivery at the scale of Facebook and support transactions at the speed of Visa.After due diligence on the current state of many blockchain projects, after deep collaboration with Ethereum developers, and after understanding their respective roadmaps, we concluded that the current and near-term Blockchain architectures cannot meet these requirements.In mid-2016, we resolved to build a better blockchain architecture."TechnologyTechnologyThe RChain decentralized applications platform is powered by the Rho Virtual Machine.Independence: Each instance of RhoVM executes an independent set of smart contracts on an independent blockchain and networks only when necessary. This means that RChain is partitioned (sharded) by default, resulting in a network of coordinated and parallel blockchains. This well sought-after "multi-chain" design is built with self-sufficiency in mind, and it represents a victory unique to RChain.Scalability: As the platform grows, nodes simply initialize new instances of RhoVM to manage the load. This allows the platform to scale linearly while keeping performance, consistency, and code complexity constant.Performance: Each instance of RhoVM is lightweight and multi-threaded, so multiple high-performance instances can exist on a single node. Thus, applications on RChain achieve unprecedented throughput, availability, and response time, opening a new landscape of decentralized applications suitable for the modern market.The visibility of a blockchain and its smart contracts, to other contracts on the network, is determined by the blockchain’s namespace.Namespaces offer developers a semi-automated framework to collocate and execute sets of contracts based on their features, dependencies, and behavioral patterns.These properties can be checked statically to help developers construct type-safe environmental policies on encryption, supported interfaces, economic protocols, identity, and much more.RChain contracts are internally concurrent. They leverage a message-passing paradigm to optimize responsiveness, offering a more dynamic and sophisticated smart contract ecosystem.In addition to concurrency, smart contracts enjoy a number of industry-leading functions:Meta-programmingReactive Data StreamsPattern MatchingAs a result, RChain contracts are matchless in throughput and programmability. What's more, every line of code on RChain obeys a well-tested, formal model of concurrent computation, allowing automatic formal verification for highly scalable contracts.Officers & TeamOfficers & Team Greg Meredith: PresidentAs the President of the RChain Cooperative, Greg is tasked with executing on the directives of the co-op board, as well as giving high level leadership to the cooperative and the RChain platform development. Kate Gonsalves: Treasurer & CFOAs the Treasurer of the RChain Cooperative, Kate will be in charge of the Co-op finances. Evan Jensen: Secretary As the Secretary for the RChain Cooperative, Evan is tasked with the creation and revision of important documentation for the cooperative, including but not limited to employee/contractor dealings.

.I Bitcoin Private private, decentralized, fast, open source, community-driven coinBitcoin Private uses the same privacy technology as ZClassic (zk-snarks). This means payments are published on a public blockchain, but the sender, recipient and other transactional metadata remain unidentifiable.Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports peer-to-peer transactions without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public ledger.Unlike Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private supports a slightly increased block size while being more anonymous and secure than any existing Bitcoin-based currency without sacrificing transaction speeds.Bitcoin Private's entire codebase is publicly available for viewing and verification by anyone. It will always remain open source and be maintained by an ever growing community.In the nature of transparency and open source, Bitcoin Private is developed by team members all over the world. Each member fills roles and contributes based on his or her skill sets.There was no premine, and there is no founder's reward. Bitcoin Private has been released in a fair manner to all. Coins were distributed on a 1:1 basis to BTC and ZCL holders.A hard fork is when a single cryptocurrency splits in two. It occurs when a cryptocurrency’s existing code is changed, resulting in both an old and new version. This case is somewhat unique, whereby ZCL and BTC were co-forked into Bitcoin Private (BTCP).Snapshot date: February 28th, 2018.  Snapshot blocks: 511346 for BTC and 272991 for ZCL. Mainnet Launch:  March 3rd 2018.When the hard fork occured, a snapshot of all existing ZCL and BTC holdings occured. Anyone holding ZCL or BTC in a wallet or supported exchange has been credited Bitcoin Private (BTCP) at a 1:1 ratio. For example, if you held 15.4 ZCL and 0.1 BTC, you receive 15.5 BTCP.Over 70 total contributors, with over 20 engineers having joined our initiative in just 30 days time!Reach out to us to join :-)Bitcoin Private is a community-driven BTC/ZCL fork consisting of over 150 talented contributors currently.

.I Golem Golem enables users and applications (requestors) to rent out cycles of other users’ (providers) machines. Any user ranging from a single PC owner to a large data center can share resources through Golem and get paid in  GNT (Golem Network Tokens) by requestors.Golem utilizes an Ethereum-based transaction system to settle payments between providers, requestors and software developers. All computations take place in sandbox environments and are fully isolated from the hosts’ systems.Software developers are in the center of Golem’s ecosystem: Our Application Registry and Transaction Framework enable anyone to deploy, distribute and monetize applications in the Golem network.Future releases of Golem will bring major improvements to the protocol in terms of its flexibility and robustness. In order to expand the user base we are already in the process of integrating a variety of new use cases to Golem in cooperation with our business and technological partners.Together with the development of Golem’s core infrastructure, our focus is going to shift towards creating tools for developers and software companies. These solutions will make Golem a competitive source of computing power and a viable alternative to existing cloud providers.The first release of our our software, Brass Golem, focuses on a single use case: CGI rendering. As a Requestor in the Golem marketplace, you can distribute processing of any Blender and LuxRenderer scene over the Golem Network.The results will arrive much faster than when running the task on your own machine at the price defined by you and accepted by suppliers of computing power (Providers). This creates a healthy competition in the marketplace created by Golem and you always know how much you are going to pay before submitting a task. Joining Golem is as easy as installing the app. What is more, Requestors can further offset the cost of computations by becoming Providers themselves, when they are not working on their own projects.Apart from the first use case (CGI rendering), we are actively investigating next use cases, with significantly larger addressable market sizes.One of the future use cases of Golem that we are actively investigating is training machine learning models. This field of computer science is going through its golden age and it has insatiable need for computing power. While right now we’re building simple proof of concept demonstrations, our ultimate goal is to be able to provide developers with a set of tools to enable them to host their machine learning stack on Golem. We believe that democratizing access to computing power at competitive price point is very important to the progress of machine learning field.

.I Basic Attenti... open source
transparent
decentralized
efficientThe token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform. The utility of the token is based on user attention, which simply means a person’s focused mental engagement.  
Digital advertising is overrun by middlemen, trackers and fraud. 
Introducing a decentralized, transparent digital ad exchange based on Ethereum Blockchain. 
Stage 1: Brave BrowserBrave is a fast, open source, privacy-focused browser that blocks malvertisements, trackers, and contains a ledger system that anonymously captures user attention to accurately reward publishers. The Basic Attention Token can be used to obtain a variety of advertising and attention-based services on the Brave platform, as it is exchanged between publishers, advertisers, and users.The token’s utility is derived from — or denominated by — user attention.Attention is really just focused mental engagement — on an advertisement, in this case. 
Stages 1 + 2 = A New Deal
The Brave browser knows where users spend their time, making it the perfect tool to calculate and reward publishers with BATs. This service creates a transparent and efficient Blockchain-based digital advertising market. Publishers receive more revenue because middlemen and fraud are reduced. Users, who opt in, receive fewer but better targeted ads that are less prone to malware. And advertisers get better data on their spending.The Brave browser anonymously monitors user attention, then rewards publishers accordingly with BATs. 
Measuring AttentionAttention is measured as users view ads and content in the browser’s active tab in real time. The Attention Value for the ad will be calculated based on incremental duration and pixels in view in proportion to relevant content, prior to any direct engagement with the ad. We will define further anonymous cost-per-action models as the system develops. Ads are then anonymously matched with customer interests using local machine learning algorithms. This means less irrelevant ads. 
Who Gets What?Users viewing ads will be rewarded with BATs. BATs can be used for premium content or services on the Brave platform.Publishers will, as part of this service, receive the lion’s share of the total ad revenue. We anticipate that users will also donate back some tokens to publishers, further increasing their revenue.  
We plan to mitigate possible ad fraud through the use of cryptography, better client-side integrity, and transparency achieved through open source.Parts of the Solution are Code CompleteMuch of the infrastructure required to deploy BAT at the back end is “code complete,” meaning it’s currently in place and being used to distribute donations to publishers based on customer attention. Use it today in the Brave Browser for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
The Basic Attention Token is the new token for the digital advertising industry. It pays publishers for their content and users for their attention, while providing advertisers with more in return for their ads.Basic Attention TokenPress? press@basicattentiontoken.orgQuestions? info@basicattentiontoken.orgTerms of Service Contributors / PublishersPrivacy Policy View PolicyJobs?

.I Fusion FUSION is an inclusive public blockchain that provides the infrastructure and architecture for fully fledged financial functions on the blockchain.FUSION is opening a new era of cryptofinance for the Internet of Values. By cooperating with financial institutions, cryptocurrency companies, 3rd party app developers, academia and the broader cryptocurrency community, FUSION is building a broad finance ecosystem on the blockchain.The FUSION Protocol provides APIs to enable different cryptocurrency tokens, off-chain values and data-sources to be mapped onto the FUSION blockchain. Any centralized or decentralized organization, blockchain community, Dapp developer or individual is welcome to build a new world of cryptofinance on the FUSION blockchain.FUSION solves the interoperability limitations within the cryptocurrency world. Multiple tokens can be mapped onto the FUSION blockchain, enabling the separation of ownership, usufruct and multi-token smart contracts.The FUSION Protocol makes “smart” contracts truly smart through the development of multiple triggering mechanisms in the calling list, an interoperability solution and functional scalability, providing the architecture for complex financial smart contracts on the blockchain.Cross-chain, cross-organization and cross-datasource inputs can be mapped onto FUSION, achieving interoperability never seen before on the blockchain. Combined with complex and nuanced smart contract functionality, FUSION is creating a completely new world of cryptofinance, opening up possibilities that have never been imagined.The FUSION public blockchain is absolutely independent from third party interference. The Distributed Control Right Management layer securely protects all locked-in cryptocurrency assets on the FUSION blockchain. By distributing and sharding private key mapping FUSION ensures that nobody can access the complete private key, making sure that no single node 
can obtain the control of digital assets. In addition to the traditional transaction triggering mechanism, FUSION introduces time and event based triggers to smart contracts. These three triggering modes are extracted from various financial scenarios and can meet the requirements of complex financial smart contracts. The HHCM takes advantages of both PoW and PoS, and utilizes parallel computing to group nodes and achieve 
a favourable balance of efficiency and safety.VisionTechnologiesRoad MapTeam & PartnersFAQVideosNewsDocumentsContactMore

.I Cortex In Cortex, due to the nature of open source and competitive mechanisms, the best model as an
                intelligent agent will survive to enhance the intelligence level of the Blockchain network.Cortex's main mission is to provide the state-of-the-art machine-learning models on the
                blockchain in which users can infer using smart contracts on the Cortex blockchain. One of
                Cortex's goals also includes implementing a machine-learning platform that allows users to post
                tasks on the platform, submit AI DApps (Artificial Intelligence Decentralized
                Applications).Cortex allows users to write machine-learning programs on the blockchain and submit
                        interactions that are dependent upon other contracts.Cortex has its own Virtual Machine, called the Cortex Virtual Machine (CVM). The CVM
                        instruction set is fully EVM compatible and has support for inference instructions.When a user initiates a transaction to a contract, the full node needs to execute the code of
                            the smart contract. The difference between Cortex and ordinary smart contracts is
                            that intelligent contracts may involve inference instructions, and then all nodes need to
                            agree on the result of this inferred result.Cortex also provides a submission interface for training off-chain, including the
                            instruction-interpreting virtual machine for models. This will setup a bridge
                            between computing power providers and algorithm providers for trading and collaboration.Machine learning researchers around the world can upload well-trained corresponding
                            data models to the storage layer. Other users who need this AI models can make inferences by
                            using models and pay to their providers.M.S. University of California, Santa Cruz, Machine Learning.M.S. Carnegie Mellon University, Civil Engineering.B.E. Tsinghua University, Civil Engineering.Co-founder of Waterhole.io.zchen@bitcointalk.

Developed by early contributors to both Bitcoin and Ethereum, Skycoin’s platform is completely secure, infinitely scalable, and ISP independent. Backed by bandwidth, storage, and computational power Skycoin is built to fulfill Satoshi’s original vision.“Net neutrality and consumer data privacy emerged as two key issues in tech in 2017. If you’re concerned about paying ridiculous fees to ISPs for unreliable coverage, having your data sold, or government monitoring and censorship - Skycoin provides hope. These are the core issues Skycoin is attempting to solve.”The Skycoin Skyminer is meticulously designed and configured to provide a rock-solid telecom backbone for the Skywire infrastructure. The custom-built hardware is focused on delivering maximum security, efficiency and performance to the software-defined network. The multi-board architecture enables each node to support an independent service on Skywire. By isolating the nodes, each service can safely operate independently of attacks on peripheral services. These service-providing nodes are managed by an OpenWRT router with strict packet forwarding and access control rules for additional security. Skyminers are paid in Coin Hours for providing services and security to the Skywire network.At Skycoin, we want to bring users what they asked for: a true, decentralized network without central authority. To accomplish this task, we went beyond PoW and PoS to create a wholly new decentralized algorithm that reconfigures the inner workings of blockchain. Our distributed consensus algorithm, Obelisk, succeeds in delivering just such a network.Its web-of-trust style consensus prevents the development of centralized power. Skycoin requires no mining, is immune to 51% attack, and transactions occur in seconds. Decisions are made through community consensus, not based on the wishes of a few majority stakeholders.The most powerful and complete cryptocurrency platform ever created.The “web of trust”, a new kind of consensus algorithm solving the fundamental flaws with PoW & PoS.The infinitely-scalable and highly customizable parallel peer-chain architecture of the Skycoin platform.The new Decentralized Internet, a wireless mesh network that pays you for supporting it.The hardware backbone for an unbreakable decentralized internet.

This is because current ICO platforms do not have the proper security measures in place for purchasers to deposit and transfer their funds.Deposits are typically transferred from one ETH address to another without proper KYC checks, often using a single publicly announced address for purchasers to send their funds. Hackers and scammers take advantage of this by posting fake ETH addresses on forums, and unsuspecting token purchasers end up transferring crypto to the hackers' addresses.To ensure this does not happen with QASH Token Sale, we have placed stringent, preventative measures to ensure a safe, secure, and compliant process for all token participants by carrying out our Token Sale only through our secure ICO and trading platform, QRYPTOS.• Developed markets that have standalone exchanges operating in closed pools of liquidity, which are not available to non-residents.• Emerging markets which are underserved with illiquid local currencies that must interact with bigger liquidity pools to utilize crypto tokens in their home currencies.QUOINE is launching a single globally-sourced tradingplatform (World Book) with an associated suiteof services (Prime Brokerage) that brings togetherthe entire global network of cryptocurrency exchanges toenable the highest level of liquidity to all markets.QUOINE's LIQUID platform is a financialutility that will benefit the entire crypto economy.A platform where token issuers, token holders,innovators, and users of next generation financialservices all benefit and contribute to Liquidity.The LIQUID platform has a distinct competitive edge over the restwith its powerful product features and success factorsin proving product-market fit.What is QASH?The next Bitcoin or Ethereum for financial services.We envision QASH to be the preferred payment token for financial services,like the Bitcoin for financial services.As more financial institutions, fintech startups and partners adopt QASHas a method of payment, the utility of QASH will scale, fuelingthe Fintech revolution.Trade QASH on all major exchanges.Pay with QASH for allQUOINE services.Use QASH as a payment token for other financial services.*QASH is not intended to constitute a security in any jurisdiction.

With its infrastructure re-built with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, MATRIX revolutionizes the user experience of executing smart contracts by making the whole process faster, easier, and safer. MATRIX offers breakthrough technologies in building highly flexible blockchain networks, which support adaptive self-optimization and multi-chain collaboration. In addition to refactoring the blockchain with AI, MATRIX also allows its mining power to serve its AI based big data applications.WHAT ARE MAIN FEATURES OF MATRIX?Thanks to the fast-growing AI technologies, MATRIX offers unique features as follows.
							1. EASIER: Allowing everybody to design smart contracts without explicit programming skills.
							2. SAFER: Making blockchains more robust under malicious attacks.
							3. FASTER: Enabling faster transactions and higher processing throughput.
							4. MORE FLEXIBLE: Seamless integration of public and private chains with the capability of adaptive optimization.WHAT IS MATRIX's CONSENSUS MECHANISM?MATRIX adopts a unique hybrid PoS + PoW consensus mechanism. The PoW is performed in a significantly smaller network of delegates, which are selected with a randomly distributed voting algorithm. The probability of a node to be selected is proportional to its PoS. The “winner” delegate shares the PoW reward with other nodes in its cluster.DOES MATRIX HAVE A MINING MACHINE?Due to the random nature of MCMC computations, the mining computing of MATRIX is better supported by dedicated stochastic hardware. The first generation of mining machine, a Bayesian reasoning machine, was already designed and prototyped. The prototyping design will be integrated as a single IC chip in the timeframe of two years.CONTACT USCopyright © 2018 MATRIX Foundation

.I Enigma Enigma is a blockchain-based protocol that uses groundbreaking privacy technologies to enable scalable, end-to-end decentralized applications. Blockchains are a revolutionary technology, but they are still held back by fundamental limitations. To build truly decentralized applications that can achieve global adoption, we need protocols like Enigma that solve these challenges.Data on the blockchain is accessible by anyone, making storing sensitive data impossible. This restricts the number of applications for blockchains.Computing on the blockchain is too slow and expensive. Storing and computing over very large amounts of data on the blockchain is not feasible.The promise of Enigma lies in its unique technology that protects privacy of data while still allowing for computation over that data.Enigma’s protocol is based on innovative privacy technologies first described in 2015 in our cofounder’s MIT thesis. With Enigma, "smart contracts" become "secret contracts", where input data is kept hidden from nodes in the Enigma network that execute code. Without this functionality to protect sensitive data, blockchains and smart contracts are either useless or not truly decentralized. Enigma is the missing piece to a decentralized future.The Enigma protocol will power an ecosystem of truly decentralized, world-changing applications.The Enigma privacy protocol allows for decentralized computation of sensitive data.On this protocol, dozens of platforms such as data marketplaces and AI exchanges can be built.This enables thousands of truly decentralized apps that require private computation and secure data.Enigma’s privacy protocol unlocks billions of dollars in value for individuals and industry. Here are just a few examples of fields our protocol can completely reshape.Users can collectively and independently monetize their data while still keeping it private from companies who wish to perform analysis, restoring power to individuals.Healthcare companies can provide data to researchers without compromising its privacy, allowing for more discoveries and innovation.Borrowers can establish their trustworthiness in a decentralized banking system without exposing their data directly to lenders, unlocking growth for lending ecosystems. Value is created through decentralized data marketplaces for the rapidly growing Internet of Things. These marketplaces will require privacy for off-chain computations to be successful at scale.Catalyst is the first application to be built on the Enigma protocol, already active with tens of thousands of users. Catalyst is a revolutionary platform for data-driven cryptoasset investing and research, built for professional crypto traders.For other inquiries, email [email protected]
.I ZCoin In order to solve the “double spending problem”, all transactions on Bitcoin must be stored on a public ledger.Notable studies have shown that the same techniques used to analyze social network topology can be used to analyze Bitcoin’s network topology.Anyone can use the public ledger to break privacy, including powerful corporations and institutions such as the NSA.With Zcoin’s Zerocoin Technology, you can “mint” a coin found on the public ledger into a private coinWhen it is time to spend your minted coin, the owner of the minted coin does not need to be revealedThe process of minting and spending a coin can be completed as many times as you want, ensuring complete privacyZcoin is the first full implementation of the Zerocoin Protocol, which allows users to have complete privacy via Zero-Knowledge cryptographic proofs. It is worth noting that Zcoin is unrelated to other cryptocurrencies utilizing the Zerocash Protocol. Although Zerocash is a development from Zerocoin, their respective implementations are not simple forks of each other, but rely on different cryptographic assumptions with various tradeoffs. Both approaches supplement each other quite nicely, and a good way to describe them would be sibling projects.The Zerocoin Protocol is being actively researched and improved, such as by a new extension that when implemented would hide transactions and address balances.Talk to usTWITTERFACEBOOKYOUTUBEREDDITYOUKUTELEGRAMWe would like to welcome Aram Jivanyan as a cryptography advisor to our team!

.I iExec RLC All about the upcoming Version 2 release: “The Dragon in the Clouds”All about the upcoming Version 2 release: “The Dragon in the Clouds”iExec provides distributed applications running on the blockchain (DApps) a scalable, secure and easy access to the services, data-sets, and computing resources they need.Our technology relies on Ethereum, which allows us to build a virtual Cloud infrastructure that provides high-performance computing services on demand.As a Developer, you can use iExec to overcome blockchain limitations, by executing your computations on a new distributed infrastructure.As a Provider, you can lend your machine power and monetize it by executing developer applications.As an Investor, you can get into the world of crypto-economy by holding or trading your RLC tokens whenever you want.RLC is the native token of the iExec cloud platform. In exchange of RLC tokens, users can utilize the network to rent servers, data and applications.Usage of Big Data and High Performance Computing (HPC) applications and the infrastructures to run them is a necessity for the design of innovative products and services.HPC is too complex and too expensive for innovative SMEs and individuals. iExec provides on-demand, secure and scalable access to an unlimited set of computing resources (CPU, storage, GPU) .Our technology is based on XtremWeb-HEP, a software for parallel and distributed computing used in production in the public domain for more than 10 years (signal processing, image, high energy physics, aeronautics, finance, etc.)iExec relies on the Ethereum blockchain to organize a global P2P market, where providers compete to rent their resources. This lowers the cost of IT and provides better energy efficiency.This week, we celebrated the first anniversary of the RLC token’s release on mainnet. Now, one year later, we are edging closer to iExec Version 2. This is a major release for the team and this Dev Letter will introduce its various innovations that have never been seen before in cloud computing.
